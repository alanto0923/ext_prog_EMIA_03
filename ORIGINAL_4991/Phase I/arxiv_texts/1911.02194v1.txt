Abstract In this paper, we address one of the main puzzles in ﬁnance obs erved in the
stock market by proponents of behavioral ﬁnance: the stock p redictability puzzle. We oﬀer a
statistical model within the context of rational ﬁnance whi ch can be used without relying on
behavioral ﬁnance assumptions to model the predictability of stock returns. We incorporate
the predictability of stock returns into the well-known Bla ck-Scholes option pricing formula.
Empirically, we analyze the option and spot trader’s market predictability of stock prices by
deﬁning a forward-looking measure which we call “implied ex cess predictability”. The em-
pirical results indicate the eﬀect of option trader’s predi ctability of stock returns on the price
of stock options is an increasing function of moneyness, whi le this eﬀect is decreasing for spot
traders. These empirical results indicate potential asymm etric predictability of stock prices
by spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with th e strike price signiﬁcantly
higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of t he underlying stock’s return should
be incorporated into the option pricing formula. In pricing options that have moneyness close
to one, stock return predictability is not incorporated int o the option pricing model because
stock return predictability is the same for both types of tra ders. In other words, spot traders
and option traders are equally informed about the future val ue of the stock market in this
case. Comparing diﬀerent volatility measures, we ﬁnd that t he diﬀerence between implied and
realized variances or variance risk premium can potentiall y be used as a stock return predictor.

11 Introduction
In an eﬃcient market, price discovery should be instantaneo us and contemporaneous. 1
Empirical evidence suggests that the excess aggregate stoc k market returns are predictable.
Using monthly, real, equal-weighted New York Stock Exchang e returns from 1941–1986,
Fama and French (1988) found that the dividend–price ratio c an explain 27% of the variation
of cumulative stock returns over the subsequent four years. Campbell and Shiller (1988)
specify econometric models of dividend discounting that im ply that price dividend ratios
predict stock returns. These two studies were among the ﬁrst to identify this as the “stock
predictability puzzle.”
There are a good number of more recent empirical studies that have investigated the
predictability of stock returns. Some believe stock return predictability is attribute to changes
in business conditions, while others attribute it to market ineﬃciency.
The majority of work on the predictability of stock returns i s based on statistical, macro,
and fundamental factor analyses models. 2Recently, a good numbers of studies in behavioral
ﬁnance have examined behavioral factors that could lead to t he predictability of stock returns.
The behavioral factors that proponents of behavioral ﬁnanc e have suggested that can lead to
stock return predictability are (1) sentiment, (2) overcon ﬁdence, (3) optimism and wishful
thinking, (4) conservatism, euphoria and gloom, (5) self-d eception, (6) cursedness, (7) belief
perseverance, and (8) anchoring. 3
Motivated by the empirical ﬁndings that stock returns are pr edictable, some researchers
have investigated the impact of stock return predictabilit y on the prices of related assets.
Lo and Wang (1995), for example, discussed the eﬀect of stock return predictability on the
price of stock options. They showed that even a small amount o f predictability could have
a signiﬁcant impact on option pricing. Liao and Chen (2006) d emonstrated that the eﬀect
of autocorrelated returns on European option prices is sign iﬁcant. Huang et al. (2009) and
Paschke and Prokopczusk (2010) oﬀer even more recent exampl es of studies about the impact
of stock returns predictability on the valuation of options . The upshot of these studies is that to
obtain more realistic stock prices, it is essential to model and analyze stock return predictability
and incorporate its impact into stock log-returns and optio n pricing models.
Modeling and analyzing the stock return predictability is c rucial for stock and risk

2managers. 4Lo and Wang (1995) introduced a model to price options when st ock returns
are predictable. Their model is based on a specially designe d multivariate trending Orn-
stein–Uhlenbeck (O-U) process includes many parameters. T he trending O-U processes with
small dimensions such as univariate and bivariate processe s are not realistic as noted by
Lo and Wang (1995). Moreover, in their model, predictabilit y is induced by the drift parame-
ter, which is not a parameter in the classical Black-Scholes model.
In this paper, we propose a method to model the prediction of s tock prices by adjusting
the stock predictability as a parameter with the Black and Sc holes (1973) and Merton (1973)
model framework by using the Stratonovich integral. 5In our model, predictability is viewed as
the dividend yield, which we refer to dividend yield due to predictability , and is incorporated
into the option pricing formula. We derive an option pricing model by incorporating the
predictable stock returns within the classical Black-Scho les-Merton (BSM) framework.
Next, we deﬁne implied excess predictability to compare an option trader’s predictability
of stock returns with that of a trader in the cash market (i.e. , spot trader). Using the observed
price of European call options based on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (S PY), we plot the implied
excess predictability against “moneyness” and time to matu rity. The pattern of the implied
excess predictability surface shows that at each maturity, an option trader’s predictability of
the SPY is an increasing function of moneyness. The turning p oint of the surface is where the
moneyness is close to 0.95. The eﬀect of option trader’s predictability of stock retur ns on the
price of stock options increases when the moneyness increas es from0.95to1.20. Conversely„
when the moneyness decreases from 0.95to0.7, the eﬀect of spot trader’s predictability of
stock returns on the price of stock options decreases. These empirical results indicate potential
asymmetric predictability of stock prices by spot and optio n traders.
We demonstrate that in pricing an option with signiﬁcant int rinsic value, stock return
predictability should be incorporated into the BSM model. I n pricing options that have
moneyness close to one stock predictability is not incorpor ated into the BSM model because
stock predictability is the same for both types of traders. I n other words, spot traders and option
traders are equally informed about stock market in this case . We show a popular stock market
volatility index — the CBOE volatility index (VIX 6) – is potentially more informative than the
other volatility measures (historical, realized, and time series estimation method volatility) for
predicting stock returns. The variance risk premium – the di ﬀerence between implied variance
and realized variance – can potentially predict stock marke t returns.
This paper is organized as follows. The next section describ es our methodology for model-
ing the prediction of stock prices. Then we derive an option p ricing formula by incorporating
the predictability of stock returns into the model. Section 3 describes the results of our model
using the S&P 500 index options. We then analyze and compare t he prediction of stock market
returns by option and spot traders. Section 5 summarizes our ﬁndings.

32 The Predictability of Stock pricing
A major issue raised by the proponents of behavioral ﬁnance i s that prices are often pre-
dictable.7. More precisely, given a stochastic basis (Ω,F,F=(Ft,t≥0),P)a price process
S(t)t≥0, deﬁned on (Ω,F,P)is not necessarilyF-adapted, it is adapted to an augmented
ﬁltrationF(∗)⊃/uniontext.1
t≥oFt, withF(∗)⊂F.
Admitting the fact that stock returns are predictable, we pr opose a method to model the
prediction of stock returns by adjusting the predictabilit y of stock returns. Our option pricing
model is close to the idea put forth by Shiller (2003) of “smar t money versus ordinary investors.”
To model the predictability of stock prices, we use the Strat onovich integral 8:
∫T
0θ(t)◦(1
2)dB(t)
=lim0=t(0)<t(1)<···<t(k)=T,t(j)=j∆t,∆t↓0/summationtext.1k−1

t(j+1)+t(j)
2/parenrightBig /parenleftBig
B(t(j+1))−B(t(j))/parenrightBig
.(1)
In (1), B(t),t≥0, is a Brownian motion generating a stochastic basis (Ω,F,F=(Ft,t≥0),P),
θ(t)t≥0isF-adapted left-continuous and locally bounded process. An i mportant property
of the Stratonovich integral is that it “looks into the futur e,” and therefore, price processes
based on the Stratonovich integral possess predictability properties. In sharp contrast, the Itô
integral:
/uni222B.dspT
0θ(t)dB(t)=lim0=t(0)<t(1)<···<t(k)=T,t(j)=j∆t,∆t↓0k−1/summationdisplay.1

t(j)/parenrightBig /parenleftBig
B(t(j+1))−B(t(j))/parenrightBig
(2)
“does not look in the future,” and thus Itô prices are not pred ictable. Combining both integrals
(1) and (2) within a Stratonovich α-integral withα∈[0,1]we obtain:
∫T
0θ(t)◦(α)dB(t)

Consider a market with two assets: (i)a risky asset (stock) Swith potentially predictive
price process S(t),t≥0, following Itô stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE):
dS(t)=µ(t,S(t))dt+σ(t,S(t))dB(t),t≥0,S(0)>0, (4)
whereµ(t,S(t))=µtS(t), andσ(t,S(t))=σtS(t), For the regularity conditions implying
existence and uniqueness of the strong solution of (3), see D uﬃe (2001, Chapter 6). By the

the model. If we assume that the stock Sprovides a continuous dividend yield of pσ2
t(i.e.,
the dividend paid over interval (t,t+dt]equals pσ2
tSt) we obtain the Black-Scholes partial
diﬀerential equation given by (12). Borrowing this idea, st ock with continuously compounded
dividend yield pσ2

tas the dividend yield due to predictability . As
the payment of dividends impacts the option price of the unde rlying stock, the stock return
predictability impacts the price of options. Depending on t he sign of p,Dy(t)could be positive
or negative. When p=0,we obtain the classical Black-Scholes equation.

3 Implied dividend yield due to predictability
In this section, we compare the option and spot trader’s pred ictability of stock returns
by deﬁning the implied excess predictability . Implied excess predictability is a metric that
captures the view of the option and spot trader of the likelih ood moves in the stock price. It
can be used to predict the of stock price from two perspective s. An important characteristic
of implied excess predictability is that it is forward looki ng. It compares the predictability of
markets for the given underlying stock market index from two perspectives. Recall that implied
excess predictability is calibrated from the BSM option pri ce formula.
We denote by pthe excess predictability of Straded by/beth(s)over theS-dynamic, when S
is traded by/beth(l). To study/beth(s)’s stock return predictability (option trader) compared to /beth(l)
(spot trader), we deﬁne implied excess predictability p=p/parenleftBig

7Thus, onQ, the SPY daily return is given by dS(t)=/parenleftbigrt−Dy(t,x)/parenrightbigS(t)dt+dB(t). The value
of a call option for the time to maturity, τ=T−t, is given by (14). We calculate the implied
excess predictability by taking the option’s market price, entering it into the (15) formula, and
back-solving for the value of p.
Here, we compare the option and spot trader’s predictabilit y of stock returns by using the
implied excess predictability. Rather than looking at indi vidual stocks, our analysis will focus
on the aggregate stock market. In our case, the SPY is the prox y we use for the aggregate stock
market. We compare the predictability of markets for the giv en underlying stock market index
from two perspectives, by doing so it provides important ins ight about the view of option and
spot traders regarding the future price of the stock market.
We use call option prices from 01/02/2015 to01/10/2015 with diﬀerent expiration dates
and strike prices. The expiration date varies from 1/2/2015 to6/20/2015, and the strike price
varies from 80to250among diﬀerent call option contracts. The midpoint of the bi d and ask
is used in the computation. As the underlying of the call opti on, the SPY index price was
206.38on01/02/2015. We use the 10-year Treasury yield curve rate 13on01/02/2015 as the
risk-free rate rt, here rt=0.0212.
As an estimates for σt, we use the following four metrics: (1) daily closing values of
V IX t/√
365; (2) historical volatility based on one-year historical da ta; (3) realized volatility
over one-year historical data; and (4) estimated volatilit y over one-year by modeling time
series with classical methods ARIMA (1,1)-GARCH (1,1)with the Student’s tdistribution as
an innovation distribution. The minimum estimated value fo rσtis derived where the realized
volatility is applied and the maximum estimated value is der ived where the daily closing values
of VIX is used .
Since implied excess predictability surfaces of all models are very similar, we plot the
excess predictability surface when σtis estimated from realized volatility. The implied excess
predictability surface is graphed against both a standard m easure of “moneyness” and time
to maturity (in year) in Figure 1. Recall that a high value for p(close to one) means excess
predictability of SPY daily return traded by /beth(s)over the predictability of SPY traded by /beth(l).
In other words, p=1means that option traders potentially predict the future of the SPY returns
better than the spot trader. The opposite is true when p=−1. Recall that the implied excess
predictability surface is an increasing function of σt.
Figure 1 indicates that at each maturity, implied excess pre dictability of option traders
increase as moneyness increases. Where the moneyness varie s in(0,0.7), the surface is ﬂat at
point−1, indicating higher predictability of spot traders compari ng to option traders. Thus,
to price signiﬁcant out-the-money options, the value of pin the model should be −1. Where
the moneyness varies in (1.05,1.15), in-the-money options, the value of pstarts increasing
from0.5, and ﬂats out at point 1. This ﬁnding indicates that option traders can potentially
predict market changes better than spot traders when the opt ion is in-the-money. In this case,
for pricing in-the-money option, the value of pin the log-return model should be 1.
The turning point of the surface is where the moneyness is clo se to0.95. When the

moneyness varies in (0.90,1.05),pvaries in(−0.5,0.5). This is the range that spot and option
traders are equally informed about the market, and the predi ctability of the market is equal
for both traders. Thus, to price options with no signiﬁcant i ntrinsic value, the classical BSM
equation can be used.
As we mentioned, the other four surfaces are very similar. He re, instead of plotting the
9four similar surfaces, we plot the relative diﬀerence of the excess predictability of each surface
to the surface derived from realized variance, denoted by pi−p1, where i=2,3,4. Here (1)
p2refers to the excess predictability surface when σtis imputed from the VIX index, (2) p3
is whereσtimputed by historical volatility, and (3) p4is whereσtis estimated by time series
models. Figures 2-4 show the relative diﬀerence of excess pr edictability for each surface. In
all surfaces, where the moneyness varies in (0.90,1.05), the relative diﬀerence is signiﬁcant.
At each value for moneyness in (0.90,1.05), the relative diﬀerence of excess predictability
increases as time to maturity increases.
Zhou (2010) deﬁned variance risk premium at time tas the diﬀerence between the ex-ante
risk-neutral expectation and the objective or statistical expectation of the return variance over
the[t,t+1]time interval,
V AR t=EQ
t(Var(rt+1))−EP
t(Var(rt+1)), (18)
which is not directly observable in practice. In practice, t he risk-neutral expectation of the return
variance, EQ
t(Var(rt+1)), is typically replaced by the VIX2index and statistical expectation of
the return variance, EP
t(Var(rt+1)), is estimated by realized variance.
Zhou (2010) showed that the diﬀerence between implied varia nce and realized variance
((i.e., variance risk premium) can be used for the short-ter m predictability of equity returns,
bond returns, forward premiums, and credit spreads. Compar ing Figures 2-4, the most signif-
icant relative diﬀerence of excess predictability is obser ved in Figure 2. It indicates that the
VIX index contains more information about the stock market c ompared to the other metrics.
Figure 3, the historical-realized surface, has the minimum relative diﬀerence.
Recall that the maximum and minimum values for σtare derived from the VIX and realized
volatility. As we observed, the most signiﬁcant relative di ﬀerence of excess predictability,
Figure 2, is derived where the VIX and realized volatility ar e used in the model. Thus, by
comparing equation (18) for diﬀerent volatility measures a nd the fact that excess predictability
is an increasing function of σt, suggests that the variance risk premium measure potential ly
contains more information compared to the other variance me asures for predicting stock market
returns. The historical volatility measure is the poorest m etric.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we studied the predictability of stock return s within the framework of rational
ﬁnance rather than relying on behavioral ﬁnance explanatio ns. We proposed a method to
model stock returns by incorporating the predictability of stock returns in the model and
then deriving an option pricing formula. To compare the pred ictability of stock returns by
option traders and spot traders, we constructed a forward-l ooking measure that compares
the option and spot trader’s stock returns predictability w hich we called the “implied excess
predictability measure.” The empirical results indicate t hat to price a signiﬁcant in-the-money
and out-the-money option, the option’s and spot trader’s pr edictability of stock returns should

be incorporated into the BSM model. For options with a small i ntrinsic values, spot traders and
option traders are equally informed,and the predictabilit y of the market is equal for both traders.
In this case, the classical BSM model can be used for option pr icing without incorporating
stock return predictability. Finally, we showed that the di ﬀerence between implied variance
11and realized variance, which we called variance risk premiu m, is an informative measure for
predicting the market in contrast to other volatility measu res.
