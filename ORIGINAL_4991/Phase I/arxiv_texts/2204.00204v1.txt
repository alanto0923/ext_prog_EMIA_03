portfolio optimization
Juntao Duan∗, Ionel Popescu†
Abstract
Minimum-variance portfolio optimizations rely on accurat e covariance estimator to
obtain optimal portfolios. However, it usually suﬀers from l arge error from sample
covariance matrix when the sample size nis not signiﬁcantly larger than the number
of assets p. We analyze the random matrix aspects of portfolio optimiza tion and iden-
tify the order of errors in sample optimal portfolio weight a nd show portfolio risk are
underestimated when using samples. We also provide LoCoV (l ow dimension covari-
ance voting) algorithm to reduce error inherited from rando m samples. From various
experiments, LoCoV is shown to outperform the classical met hod by a large margin.
Keywords: portfolio optimization; covariance; LoCoV; low dimension covariance voting
1 Introduction
Portfolio theory pioneered by Markowitz in 1950’s [9] is at t he center of theoretical developments
in ﬁnance. The mean-variance model tells investors should h old a portfolio on the eﬃcient frontier
which trade oﬀ portfolio mean (return) against variance (ri sk). In practice, mean and variance
are calculated using estimated sample mean and sample covar iance matrix. However, estimation
error in sample mean and covariance will signiﬁcantly aﬀect t he accuracy of the portfolio thus
perform poorly in practice (see [7, 10]). Quantitative resu lt on how sample covariance aﬀects the
performanceare very limited. Thebias in sampleportfoliow eight is discussedin [5] butnopractical
guidance is given on how large is the bias when use mean-varia nce model with sample data. We in
this work will obtain that the order of magnitude of the error in sample portfolio weight which is
large when the sample size nis comparable to the number of assets p. And the error decays in the
rate of/radicalBig
p
nasnincreases.
For this reason, there has been many work suggest diﬀerent app roaches to overcome standard
mean-variance portfolio optimizations. These suggestion s include imposing portfolio constraints
(see [6, 3, 1]), use of factor models ([2]), modifying object ive to be more robust ([4]) and improving
samplecovariancematrixestimation ([8]). Instead, inthi sworkweusetheobservationfromrandom
matrix theory to provide alternative view on the error in sam ple covariance matrix. We propose
LoCoV, low dimension covariance voting, which eﬀectively ex ploits the accurate low dimensional

1covariance to vote on diﬀerent assets. It outperform the stan dard sample portfolio by a large
margin.
We shall ﬁrst set up the problem. For simplicity, we only disc uss minimum-variance portfolio
optimization. Assume the true covariance admits diagonali zation
Σ =PTD2P
whereDis a non-negative deﬁnite diagonal matrix, and Pis an orthogonal matrix. Then a data
matrix (asset return) realized by random matrix N(n×p) with i.i.d. standard random variables is
X=NDP
a sample covariance matrix is then obtained as
ˆΣ =PTDNTN
nDP
We deﬁne the minimum variance portfolio to be the optimizer o f

s.t. wT/BD= 1(1.1)
where /BD=/bracketleftbig
1···1/bracketrightbigT. In reality, Σ is not known, therefore it is replaced by an est imatorˆΣ to
obtain an approximated optimal portfolio. That is we solve
min
wwTˆΣw
s.t. wT/BD= 1(1.2)
2 Universality of optimal portfolio weight and risk
We ﬁrst derive the solution of minimum-variance by the metho d of Lagrange multiplier since a
closed form is available. Later on based on the explicit form of the solutions, we will investigate
probabilistic properties of portfolio weight and risk.
Observe that both Σ and ˆΣ take the form ATAwhereAisDPfor true covariance Σ and A
is1√nNDPfor the sample covariance matrix ˆΣ. We shall deﬁne the portfolio optimization in the
general form
min
wwTATA w
s.t. wT/BD= 1(2.1)
Deﬁne the Lagrangian function
L(w) =wTATAw−λ(wT/BD−1)
Taking derivatives with respect to the portfolio weight w, and set the gradient to be zero,
∇L= 2wTATA−λ /BDT= 0
write gradient as column vector this is
2ATAw=λ /BD
2For real life portfolio optimization, we can assume ATA(Σ orˆΣ) is invertible since otherwise
optimal portfolio weight will have large error or ambiguity . Then we ﬁnd the optimal portfolio
weight
w=λ
2(ATA)−1/BD
We know the portfolio weights should be normalized so that th ey sum up to 1. Therefore λ/2 is
essentially a normalizing factor. For convenience of notat ion, we make the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1. Thefree (non-normalized) optimal weight of portfolio optimization 2.1 is
S=/bracketleftbig
s1···sp/bracketrightbigT= (ATA)−1/BD
And denote its sum as

i=1si= 2/ba∇dblS/ba∇dbl−1
s. Then take dot product of ∇Landw, we ﬁnd
0 =∇LTw= 2wTATAw−λ /BDTw
and recall /BDTw= 1, therefore, we ﬁnd the minimum portfolio risk
R(w∗) =w∗TATAw∗=λ∗/2 =/ba∇dblS/ba∇dbl−1

We summarize the result as follows,

32.1 Behavior of sample portfolio
Assume the diagonalization of true covariance matrix
Σ =PTD2P=PTdiag(σ2
1,···,σ2
p)P
By proposition 2, plugging in ATA= Σ, we ﬁndthe true free optimal weight andtrue optimal
portfolio weight of 1.1 are
SΣ= Σ−1/BD=PTD−2P /BD, w∗=/ba∇dblSΣ/ba∇dbl−1
sSΣ (2.5)
Then recall the return (data matrix) is generated as X=NDPwhereNis an×pmatrix with
i.i.d. standard random variables (mean zero and variance on e). This leads to the sample covariance
matrix
ˆΣ =PTDNTN
nDP
Plugging in ATA=ˆΣ for proposition 2, we obtain sample free optimal weight andsample
optimal portfolio weight of 1.2

covariance matrix. It is possible to directly use the formul a for inverse from Cramer rule to analyze
this random matrix and show EM=I. Since this work mainly focus on improving the accuracy of
portfolio, we will not pursue the probabilistic properties here (which shall be discussed in another
work elsewhere). Instead we use several experiments to show the sample portfolio weight ˆ w∗is
centered around the true portfolio weight w∗.
2.2 First example: sample portfolio of independent assets
We shall start with the simplest case that all assets are inde pendent, i.e. the matrix Pis identity.
This means the true covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix Σ = D2. Then by 2.5 true free

Since we are using non-identity orthogonal matrix Pto create dependence among the assets,
the true optimal portfolio weight is not ordered. The concen tration and deviation properties of the
sample portfolio weight has not changed. On the left ﬁgure 2, true optimal weight is the red line
which is still closely aligned with the mean value of sample o ptimal weights which is shown as blue

the right, the sample optimal risk has higher chance of under estimate the true optimal risk. As
p/ndecreases, both sample weight and sample risk become more ac curate.
2.4 The order of error in sample optimal portfolio
We summarize our ﬁndings from previous examples and experim ents as the following conjecture
6Conjecture 1. Error estimates for ˆw∗(2.6) compared with w∗( 2.5): If assume eigenvalues of true

Even though we can not prove this in full generality, we can sh ow

diag(σ1,···σp)and asset return data X=NDPwhereNis an×pmatrix with i.i.d. standard
Gaussian random variables (mean zero and variance one). And the sample covariance matrix

83 LoCoV: low dimension covariance voting
So far we have seen that large errors are present when we use 1. 2 to approximate 1.1 especially
whenp/nis not small. The natural question is whether there is a rescu e to reduce the errors when
pandnare comparable. The answer is positive and we provide LoCoV a lgorithm, low dimension
covariance voting, which consistently outperform the samp le optimal portfolio ˆ w∗.
Let us start with the motivation behind LoCoV. From random ma trix theory, the sample
covariance approaches to the true covariance as p/n→0. Suppose we have n= 30 samples for
p= 30 assets. Then for any two assets, XkandXt, the 2×2 samplecovariance matrix ˆΣksfor assets
XkandXthas 30 samples thus feature-to-sample ratio is 2 /30 which is much smaller compared
with 30/30 for the sample covariance matrix ˆΣ for all 30 assets.
On the other hand, philosophically portfolio optimization is to compare diﬀerent assets and ﬁnd
proper investment hedges (ratios). Since we have a very accu rate sample covariance matrix ˆΣktfor
assetXkandXt, we can ﬁnd accurate investment relative-weights ( uk,ut), invest ukon asset Xk
anduton asset Xt, by solving 1.2. As we repeat this process for any pair of two a ssets, we can
use these low dimension covariance matrices ˆΣktto accurately construct ratios ( uk,ut) and then
we utilize all p2pairs of ratios to vote on each assets and obtain a ﬁnal portfo lio weight vector.

And we can easily generalize this algorithm to that using k×kdimensional covariance and
9solve corresponding 1.2 for kassets instead of using 2 ×2 low dimensional covariance. Therefore
we propose the following ‘LoCoV- k’ algorithm.

In LoCoV- k, there are several tweaks from LoCoV-2 in order to adapt to k-assets. Every time
we solve a k-assets portfolio optimization problem, we obtain krelative weights. In order to use
allkweights, we initialize the relative-weight matrix Uwith all entries being1
k. If there is a new
weight generated from the computation, we take average of th e existing weight and the new weight.
This update will diminish old weights which is only for conve nience reading and understanding the
algorithm. One could take a more delicate update on entries o fU, for example keep track of the
total number of weights generated for each entry, and then up date with an average of all weights.
4 Simulations
We run three experiments and select Σ = I,D2,PTD2P. For each experiment, we generate 300
samples ˆΣ and compute corresponding ˆ w∗and LoCoV estimator. We plot ˆ w∗in green and LoCoV-
10weight in black. The experiments show LoCoV consistently ou tperforms the sample optimal port-
folio.

5 Conclusion and open question
We analyzed the minimum variance portfolio question with th e consideration of randomness of
sample covariance matrix. In light of random matrix theory, we use experiments showed the error
in sample optimal portfolio has the order of the assets-to-s ample ratio p/n. When number of assets
pis not considerably smaller than the number of samples n, the sample optimal portfolio fails to
provide accurate estimation of true optimal portfolio. Thu s we proposed the LoCoV method which
exploits the fact that k-dimensional sub-covariance matrix is more accurate thus c an be used to
produce relative weights among kassets. Using relative weights to uniformly vote on given as sets
eventually improve dramatically on the performance of the p ortfolio.
5.1 Adapt LoCoV to general mean-variance portfolio
Wehavenotdiscussedtheroleofmeanreturnandassumedourd ataiscentered. Toadapttogeneral
non-centered mean-variance portfolio optimization, one m ust modify the k-assets optimization sub-
