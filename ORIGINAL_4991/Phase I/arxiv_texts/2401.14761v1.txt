Abstract
This paper proposes an algorithmic trading framework integrating Environmen-
tal, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings with a pairs trading strategy. It addresses
the demand for socially responsible investment solutions by developing a unique al-
gorithm blending ESG data with methods for identifying co-integrated stocks. This
allows selecting profitable pairs adhering to ESG principles. Further, it incorporates
technical indicators for optimal trade execution within this sustainability framework.
Extensive back-testing provides evidence of the model’s effectiveness, consistently
generating positive returns exceeding conventional pairs trading strategies, while
upholding ESG principles. This paves the way for a transformative approach to
algorithmic trading, offering insights for investors, policymakers, and academics.
Keywords: ESG, Pairs Trading, Sustainable Investing
1 Introduction
In a world that is increasingly interconnected and faced with challenges of climate change,
the long term survival as well as success of a firm is contingent on factors beyond the
realm of traditional metrics of financial performance. Accordingly, Environmental Social
and Governance (ESG) considerations have emerged as a pivotal driver of sustainable per-
formance of firms, not only from the perspective of investment decisions and risk manage-
ment, but also from the viewpoint of consumer preferences, as well as regulatory practices,
all of which, eventually has a bearing on the reputation and viability of a firms’ operation
[13]. At the heart of ESG standing of a firm lies the encompassing of the environmental im-
pact, which can be attributed to the firm, the stakeholders of the firm and the consequent
practices of corporate governance. In this context, particular consideration is extended to

the effort towards management of emission, reduction of waste and conservation of natural
resources.
In order to facilitate the tangible assessment of the ESG performance of a firm, in case
of the environment component, one can adopt metrics such as per unit (of production)
energy consumption, extent of green house gas (GHG) emission and level of recycling
as well as conservation efforts [14]. The social dimension of ESG, emphasizes on the
relationship that a firm shares with its stakeholders, both internal (ethical workplace
practices, diversity and inclusion) and external (engagement with the local community
and philanthropic outreach activities). Some of the metrics which can be adopted for
this, include employee turnover, workplace safety, customer satisfaction and community
engagement [12]. Finally, on the criterion of good governance, the firm may be assessed via
metrics like diversity indices, corporate governance ratings and performance on account
of regulatory compliance.
Market-based tools like emissions trading schemes, carbon taxes, and carbon deriva-
tives drive GHG emissions cuts. Emissions trading schemes work by capping emissions
and issuing tradeable permits (which the firm can trade based on their emission levels).
This enables reducing emission in a flexible and cost-effective manner [6]. Challenges with
over-allocated permits, thereby leading to reduced prices can be addressed via mechanisms
like the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) Market Stability Reserve,
which reduces the surplus supply of permits [7].
The social cost of carbon, also called the carbon tax or carbon price, is the emissions
tax per ton of CO2 [10]. The tax level incentives shifts to low-carbon options across
sectors. Examples of successful carbon tax initiatives exist in Nordic countries, with
Sweden instituting a 1991 carbon tax covering about half its emissions. The tax design
balances emissions cuts, competitiveness and social impacts. Revenues generated from
carbon tax can also result in additional environmental and economic gains.
Additionally, carbon derivatives help firms hedge risks from carbon price fluctuations
due to market-based tools. European companies covered by EU ETS use futures and
option contracts on EU Allowances (EUAs) to provide price certainty over compliance
periods [8]. As more countries implement carbon pricing, the carbon derivative markets
is likely to experience growth, though transparency, regulation and liquidity challenges
remain. Overall these flexible approaches mobilize private capital towards needed low-
carbon investments, which is the genesis of this paper.
2 Data Analysis and Asset Picking
In this section we present a description of data sourcing and their analysis, followed by
the presentation of the approach adopted for selection of asset (stocks) for inclusion in the
portfolio. The ESG data for firms of Indian market was obtained from the CSRHub on-
line repository [3]. This comprehensive data set includes monthly historical ESG records
pertaining to a large number of firms, along with information identifying to the corre-
2sponding industries to which the firms’ belong, offering detailed insight into the ESG
practices adopted by these firms. In particular, our comprehensive exercise of extraction
and collation of the data, resulted in a total of 133 unique industrial sectors and 1,392
unique firms, with the some of the key statistics resulting from the analysis of the data,
are as enumerated below:
(A) The average ESG score across all firms was determined to be approximately 56 .46.
(B) The average ESG score across all industries was approximately 54 .91.
(C) Out of the total of 1,392 firms analyzed, 570 firms did not have recorded ESG scores.
(D) The firm with the highest ESG score was FLEX-FOODS-LIMITED, with a perfect
score of 100 .0.
(E) The firm with the lowest ESG score was Tide-Water-Oil-India-Co-Ltd, with a score
of 0 (though might also indicate the absence of a recorded ESG score).
The histogram of the distribution of ESG scores in Figure 1, from which we infer the
following:
(A) A significant number of firms have ESG scores in the range of approximately 40 to
80.
(B) There’s a peak around the score of 84, followed by a decline. However there are
several firms achieving perfect scores.
(C) Fewer firms have very low ESG scores, with a slight rise in the number of firms having
scores close to 0 (though this may be attributed to the absence of data).
Figure 1: Distribution of ESG Score
The trends of average ESG scores are present in Figure 2, from which we surmise the
following :
(A) The ESG scores generally show an upward trend, indicating that, on average, firms
are improving their ESG performance over time.
3(B) There are some fluctuations in the scores, but the overall trajectory seems positive.
(C) The final dip maybe due to addition of more new data in 2023.

Table 2: Bottom 5 industry ESG scores
For the asset picking exercise, in this paper, we adopt two distinct methodologies for
stock selection utilizing ESG scores, as enumerated below:
(A) Approach 1:
(i) Categorizing the firms according to their respective industries.
(ii) Computing the average ESG score for all firms within each industry for a specific
timestamp.
(iii) From each industry group, the firm that exhibits the highest ESG score for that
timestamp is identified.
(iv) Only firms whose ESG score exceeds a threshold parameter ζ(contingent on
the ESG value specified in the preceding step) are considered.
(B) Approach 2:
(i) Evaluation of each firm’s ESG score in relation to the average score of its re-
spective industry.
(ii) Select firms that outperform their industry average in terms of ESG scores by
a given specified margin ξ.
The stocks selected based on the aforesaid approaches will be identified by the term “stock
universe”, and this will then be employed for subsequent portfolio construction.
3 Methodology
In this section, we focus on the identification of stock pairs for the purpose of pairs trading,
a strategy that is driven fundamentally via the notions of mean reversion and stationarity.
5While the former indicates a tendency of values (in a time series) reverting back to the
average, the latter encapsulates situations where the statistical properties do not exhibit
any temporal changes. For the purpose of this work, we adopt four tests, namely, unit root
tests, Engle-Granger co-integration test, Hurst exponent and half-life test, all of which we
briefly elaborate upon in the following discussion.
The unit root test that was chosen for this work is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) test, whose purpose is to ascertain the presence of a unit root in the series, thereby
implying the existence of non-stationarity in the series. If the ADF test statistic is more
negative than the critical value (as obtained from Dickey and Fuller table), then it indicates
stationarity of the series and in case it is less negative than the critical value, then it is
suggestive of non-stationarity [2].
The co-integration tests due to Engle and Granger [5] describes a comprehensive
methodology to ascertain the co-integration of two time series, with the specific procedure
being accomplished through a two time-step method. In the first step (of the procedure)
an ordinary least square (OLS) approach is used to determine the coefficient of a linear
relation assumed between the two times series. This is followed by the second step wherein
the residual of the linear relation is tested for stationarity, which if it holds, implies the
co-integration between the two time series.
In case of a time series for prices, the rate of price diffusivity can be quantitatively
determined. If the (logarithmic) price series does not exhibit the geometric Brownian
walk, then contingent on the Hurst exponent, one can conclude whether the series exhibits
mean-reverting (anti-persistent), uncorrelated or trending (persistent) behaviour [2].
Finally, we dwell upon the key factor of mean-reversion half-life, which indicates the
time taken for a series to revert to its mean level [2]. Assuming a mean-reversion model,
with a corresponding mean-reversion factor, one may conclude mean reversion (exponential
decay), contingent on whether the mean reversion factor is positive (negative). In fact,
the mean reversion speed is observed to be inversely proportional to the absolute value of
mean-reversion factor.
4 APO Based Trading Strategy
In this section we present our trading strategy based on the Absolute Price Oscillator
(APO) [5], an approach used to identify potential trading opportunities contingent on the
price momentum of assets. This strategy makes use of the difference observed between
a fast and a slow Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to ascertain the entry and exit
strategy for the trades. A rising and a falling APO indicates bullish and bearish momen-
tum, respectively. The first step in our strategy involves the adoption of the following pair
selection approach as enumerated below and summarized in Algorithm 1.
(A) Dimensionality Reduction: This step involves processing the financial data to find a
compact representation for each security. Dimensionality reduction is crucial when
dealing with large datasets to reduce the computational load while still capturing
6the most significant features that contribute to the variability in the data. Tech-
niques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Singular Value Decomposi-
tion (SVD) can be used to reduce the number of variables, with the former (PCA)
being used in this work.
(B) Clustering with OPTICS: After reducing the dimensionality, the next step is to apply
a clustering algorithm to group similar data points. OPTICS (Ordering Points To
Identify the Clustering Structure) is a clustering algorithm [1] that can handle varying
densities and is robust to outliers, making it suitable for financial datasets where such
characteristics are common. This step will organize the securities into clusters based
on their similarities in the reduced dimensional space.
(C) Forming Pairs: Once the clusters are formed, the final step is to select all possible
pair combinations within each cluster. Since securities within the same cluster are
similar according to the chosen metrics and dimensions, they are likely candidates for
pairs trading. This step involves generating pairs that will then be evaluated based on
their trading potential, typically through metrics like co-integration, mean reversion,
and other statistical measures relevant to pairs trading strategies [11].

9:end procedure
In the second step, we introduce the APO spread trading strategy which capitalizes on
the spread differences between two correlated assets. The algorithm computes a hedge ratio
to form a spread series, which is then analyzed for trading signals based on the APO [4].
This method provides a systematic approach to pairs trading, focusing on the principles
of mean reversion. It leverages statistical methods to form a hedge position between two
assets, aiming to profit from convergence in their price series. By continuously monitoring
the APO spread, the strategy can adapt to market movements, making it a dynamic tool
for traders. The specifics of the APO based approach adopted by us is enumerated in
Algorithm 2.

5 Results
For the empirical analysis, our data set comprises a comprehensive selection of equities
listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) [9] of India. In the initial data acquisition
phase, we encountered the common challenge of data sparsity and non-uniformity, which
necessitated a meticulous data cleaning process. We focused on ensuring that only stocks
with a complete and consistent set of historical data were retained for further analysis,
thereby eliminating any securities that could introduce bias or inaccuracy due to incom-
plete information. Post the data cleaning step, we applied the ESG filtering criterion
and selected only those firms that demonstrated superior ESG performance relative to
the industry average. The final data set, after rigorous cleaning and applying the ESG
filter, consisted of a balanced panel of equities that are both representative of the market
and reflective of high sustainability standards. This data set forms the backbone of our
analysis, ensuring that our pairs trading strategy is both financially sound and ethically
responsible. Finally, for the purpose of backtesting we used a commission rate of 0 .1%.
The results for the training set are presented in Table 3 from where we see that pairs
8with high Sharpe Ratios and low drawdowns, like “GESHIP and SOMANYCERA” and
“BAJAJELEC and GSPL”, are generally more favorable as they suggest efficient risk-
adjusted returns with lower declines. Pairs with high returns but also high drawdowns,
such as “CCL and SSWL” and “ADANIPORTS and ASHOKLEY”, might have provided
good returns but at higher risk levels. Consistency between training and testing perfor-
mance is crucial for validating any trading strategy, so it’s important to compare these
training results with out-of-sample testing results for a comprehensive assessment.

The wide range of Sharpe Ratios and Test Returns indicates that performance varies
significantly across different pairs. From Table 4 we notice that pairs like “RADICO
and TATAELXSI” and “ADANIPORTS and ASHOKLEY” show high Sharpe Ratios and
positive returns, suggesting they performed well during the test period. On the other
hand, pairs like “CENTRALBK and ENGINERSIN” and “INDIANB and MRPL” with
9negative Sharpe Ratios and returns indicate underperformance.

The cointegration values suggest how strongly the pairs are correlated in the long term.
From Table 5 we infer that pairs like “BALRAMCHIN and IIFL” or “DCBBANK and
SOUTHBANK” have a stronger cointegration, meaning these pairs are more likely to move
together over time. Lower values, like in “GOKEX and GOCLCORP” or “BAJAJHLDNG
and MAHSCOOTER” suggest weaker cointegration, indicating less predictability in the
movement of these pairs together over time.

Finally, We can draw various conclusions about the data by plotting the box plots.
The box plot for Sharpe ratios in Figure 3 indicates a median near zero, with a wide
interquartile range and outliers in both directions, signifying a mix of pairs with both high
and low risk-adjusted returns. The drawdown box plot in Figure 4 shows a low median with
most data clustered in a narrow range, suggesting consistent potential drawdown across
pairs, yet with some notable high-drawdown outliers. The returns box plot in Figure 5
displays a concentration of pairs with modest median returns, a tight interquartile range,
and a few exceptional outliers.

126 Conclusion and Future Directions
This paper introduces a pairs trading algorithm combining ESG measures for sustain-
able asset picking. Quantitative techniques, including, cointegration, mean reversion and
dimensionality reduction are combined with the APO spread trading approach to algorith-
mically identify and trade pairs. Although backtests show differences between train and
test results, some top pairs display strong signals, integration and positive risk-adjusted
gains over both (train and test) periods, indicating feasibility, in terms real-life trading.
Overall this study connects ethical investing and statistical arbitrage, providing a frame-
work positioned to traverse markets, while upholding sustainability values.
Future work would involve application of this strategy to high-frequency data in order
to uncover more trading opportunities and understand short term price moves, despite
increased complexity. Additional dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE could re-
veal new data patterns missed by PCA. Exploring clustering algorithms beyond OPTICS
may provide fresh insights and alternative pairs. Machine learning approaches could dy-
namically determine entry and exit points, thereby adapting the strategy to evolving
markets. The model could also integrate other performance factors like macroeconomic
and sentiment indicators or more nuanced ESG metrics. In summary, integrating high-
frequency data, new dimensionality and clustering techniques, and advanced machine
learning promises an adaptive, robust strategy aligning of financial and sustainability
objectives.
