Abstract. LetQ(α) be the simplest cubic ﬁeld, it is known that
Q(α) can be generated by adjoining a root of the irreducible equa-
tionx3−kx2+ (k−3)x+ 1 = 0, where kbelongs to Q. In this
paper we have established a relationship between α,α′andk,k′
whereαis a root of the equation x3−kx2+ (k−3)x+ 1 = 0
andα′is a root of the same equation with kreplaced by k′and
Q(α) =Q(α′).
1.Introduction
Every simplest cubic ﬁeld can be generated by adjoining a root of
the equation [3]
(1) x3−kx2+(k−3)x+1 = 0,
for some suitable k, wherekis a parameter belonging to set of ra-
tional numbers. Conversely, the roots of (1), for some rational number
k, are either rational or generate a simplest cubic ﬁeld.
It can be observed that two diﬀerent values of parameters can ge n-
erate the same simplest cubic ﬁeld. In this paper we will classify the
parameters according to the corresponding simplest cubic ﬁelds. W e
also found the relation between the roots of equation (1) for diﬀer ent
values of parameters belonging to the same class.
We assert that these relations could be a step forward to underst and
about integral points on elliptic curves related to simples cubic ﬁelds

Each element ωofQ(α) has the linear fractional representation ω=
aρ+b
cρ+d, where the determinant of ω, denoted by det( ω), is deﬁned as
ad−bc.An element ωofQ(α) is rational if and only if det( ω) = 0.
2.Relationship between αand´αwhenQ(α) =Q(α′)
First we split the simplest cubic ﬁeld into classes. Each element ωof
Q(α) is related to a linear fractional transformation f∈PSL(2,Q) in

thewaythatallitsconjugatescanbeobtainedbyapplying fn, forsome
integern, overω. Weshall callthiscorrespondence as“linear fractional
transformation related to an element of Q(α)”. This correspondence
deﬁnes an equivalence relation on Q(α) and each class corresponds to
a unique element of PSL(2,Q).
We call the equivalence class related to a linear fractional transfor -
mationfasf-class. The following corollary is straightforward to see.
Corollary 1. Ifω∈Q(ρ), thenωand its conjugates belong to the
samef-class.
The elements belonging to y-class, where yis deﬁned as z/ma√sto−→z−1
z,
are instrumental in establishing a relationship between α,α′andk,k′
whereαis a root of Equation 1 and α′is a root of same equation with
kreplaced by k′andQ(α) =Q(α′). The following example shows an
element belonging to y-class.
Example 1. The roots of the equation x3−3x2+1 = 0are given by
ρ,ρ−1
ρ,−1
ρ−1.
whereρ= 2cos(π/9)+1. The algebraic number ρbelongs to y-class
Note that in y-class there are more than one elements, for instance,
fork= 3 the roots of Equation 1, are ρ= 2cos(π/9) + 1,ρ´ =
−cos(π/9) + 1−√
3sin(π/9) andρ′′=−cos(π/9) + 1 +√
3sin(π/9)
and the following two numbers belong to y-class

and the following equations

x3−/parenleftbigg3

are respectively satisﬁed by them.
Lemma 1. An element ωofQ(α)belong to y-class if and only if it is
a root of the irreducible equation x3−kx2+(k−3)x+1 = 0, wherek
is a rational number.
Proof.Letωbe an element of y-class so the other conjugates of ωare
ω−1
ω,−1
ω−1and the equation satisﬁed by them is:
(x−ω)(x−ω−1
ω)(x+1
ω−1) = 0SIMPLEST CUBIC FIELDS 3
which can be simpliﬁed as
x3−kx2+(k−3)x+1 = 0
wherek=ω+ω−1
ω−1
ω−1. Herekmust be rational because it is evolved
from the equation satisﬁed by ω, which is algebraic over Qof degree
three.
Conversely, let ωsatisfy an irreducible equation of the form x3−
kx2+(k−3)x+1 = 0, where kis a rational number. Then the other
two roots of the equation areω−1
ωand−1
ω−1. Moreover, ( ω)y=(ω−1)
ω,
(ω−1
ω)y=−1
(ω−1)and (−1
ω−1)y=ωimply that ωand its conjugates lie in
the same triangle. /square
Thus, corresponding to each “triplet of conjugates” of y-class there
is a rational number k. We call such correspondence as the element of
y-class with parameter k.
We use the above classiﬁcation of elements of y-class to prove the
following.
Proposition 1. Elements of Q(α)belonging to y-class are of the form
(c+d)α−c
cα+d, wherecanddare non-zero integers.
Proof.Letω=aα+b
cα+dbeanyprimitiveelement in Q(α), thatis, ad−bc/ne}ationslash=
0. Then the conjugates of ωare given by
ω′=(a+b)α−a
(c+d)α−c,
and
ω′′=bα−(a+b)
dα−(c+d).
Our next aim is to ﬁnd the values of a,b,canddsuch that ωbelongs
toy-class, that is, when
(ω)y=ω′(2.1)
(ω′)y=ω′′
(ω′′)y=ω.
Now from the ﬁrst of these equations, we get
(a−c)α+(b−d)
aα+b=λ(a+b)α−λa
λ(c+d)α−λc,
which further yields the following four equations
a(1−λ)−c−λb= 0,λa+b−d= 0,
a−λ(c+d) = 0 and b+λc= 0.4 Q. MUSHTAQ AND S. IQBAL
But the det(λ(a+b)α−λa
λ(c+d)α−λc) =det(ω) which is possible if λ=±1. For
λ=−1, the above system of equations gives a=b=c=d= 0,
contradicting the primitivity of ω. The solution of the system for λ= 1
isa=c+d,b=−c,c=c,d=d. This solution satisﬁes the other
two Equations of (2.1). So the elements of y-class are of the form
(c+d)α−c
cα+d. /square
Now we are in a position to state the theorem which establishes a
relationship between αandα′whenever Q(α) =Q(α′).
Theorem 1. Ifαis a root of the irreducible equation x3−kx2+(k−
3)x+ 1 = 0 andα′is a root of the same irreducible equation except k
is replaced by k′thenQ(α) =Q(α′)if and only if α′is of the form
(c+d)α−c
cα+dorαis of the form(c+d)α′−c
cα′+dfor some integer values of cand
d, not both zero.
2.1.Relationship between kandk′whenQ(α) =Q(α′).Hence
we will answer the next question about simplest cubic ﬁeld. First we
will ﬁnd the equation satisﬁed by any element ω=aρ+b
cρ+dof the simplest
cubic ﬁeld Q(ρ) whereρis the root of the equation x3−kx2+ (k−
3)x+1 = 0. Therepresentationof ωasalinearcombinationof {1,ρ,ρ2}
obtained by the method of indeterminate coeﬃcients is given by
ω=a2

where
a1= (−c(bc−da))
b1= ((ck+d)(bc−da))
c1= (ac2−bc2k+3bc2−bdck−d2b)
d1= (−c2kd+3c2d−d2ck−d3+c3)
are rational integers. Then equation satisﬁed by ωis:
z3+z2/parenleftbigg2bdck+3d2b+bc2k−3ac2−3bc2+kd2a+2ckda−6cda

−c2kd+3c2d−d2ck−d3+c3/parenrightbigg
= 0,SIMPLEST CUBIC FIELDS 5
Equation satisﬁed by elements of y-class can be obtained by putting
a=c+d,b=−cin above equation
z3−z2t+z(t−3)+1 = 0,
wheretis given by
t=9d2c+c3k+9c2d−3d2ck−kd3
−c2kd+3c2d−d2ck−d3+c3.
The following three elements
w= ((c+d)α−c
cα+d),w´= (dα−(c+d)
(c+d)α−c),w′′= (−cα−d
dα−(c+d))
are the roots of the Equation 3.2. Hence if αis a root of x3−kx2+
(k−3)x+ 1 = 0 and α´is a root of the same equation, except kis
replaced by k, such that Q(α) =Q(α′) then the relationship between
kandk´is given by
k´=9d2c+c3k+9c2d−3d2ck−kd3
−c2kd+3c2d−d2ck−d3+c3.
From now onwards, we shall write the above relation between kand
k′ask′=T(c,d,k).
Hence we can state:
Theorem 2. Ifαis a root of the equation x3−kx2+(k−3)x+1 = 0
andα′is a root of the same equation, except kis replaced by k′, then
Q(α) =Q(α′)if and only if k′=T(c,d,k)for integers canddnot both
zero.
We deﬁne a relation Ron set of rational numbers as aRbif there
exist integers canddsuch that k′=T(c,d,k). It can be easily seen
that the relation Ris equivalence relation. Hence,
Theorem 3. There is one-to-one correspondence between the equiva-
lence classes of Rand distinct simplest cubic ﬁelds and vice versa, with
the exception of one equivalence class {k:k=(p3−3pq2+q3)
(qp(−q+p)), for some
integerspandqsuch that 0/ne}ationslash=p/ne}ationslash=q/ne}ationslash= 0}.6 Q. MUSHTAQ AND S. IQBAL
