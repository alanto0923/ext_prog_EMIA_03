Abstract
This paper is concerned with palindromes occurring in chara cteristic Sturmian words cαof slope
α, whereα∈(0,1) is an irrational. As cαis a uniformly recurrent inﬁnite word, any (palindromic)
factor of cαoccurs inﬁnitely many times in cαwith bounded gaps. Our aim is to completely describe
where palindromes occur in cα. In particular, given any palindromic factor uofcα, we shall establish
a decomposition of cαwith respect to the occurrences of u. Such a decomposition shows precisely
whereuoccurs in cα, and this is directly related to the continued fraction expa nsion of α.

1 Introduction
The fascinating family of Sturmian words consists of all aperiodic inﬁn ite words having exactly n+ 1
distinct factors of length nfor eachn∈N. Such words have many applications in various ﬁelds of
mathematics, such as symbolic dynamics, the study of continued fr action expansion, and also in some
domains of physics (crystallography) and computer science (form al language theory, algorithms on
words, pattern recognition). Sturmian words admit several equiv alent deﬁnitions and have numerous
characterizations; in particular, they can be characterized by th eir palindrome or return word structure
[10, 16]. For a comprehensive introduction to Sturmian words, see f or instance [1, 2, 23] and references
therein.
Sturmian words have exactly two factors of length 1, and thus are inﬁnite sequences over a two-letter
alphabet A={a,b}, say. Here, an inﬁnite word (orsequence )xoverAis a map x:N→ A. For any
i≥0, we setxi=x(i) and write x=x0x1x2···, eachxi∈ A. Central to our study is the following
characterizationof Sturmian words, which was originally proved by M orse and Hedlund [21]. An inﬁnite
wordsoverA={a,b}is Sturmian if and only if there exists an irrational α∈(0,1), and a real number
ρ, such that sis equal to one of the following two inﬁnite words:
sα,ρ, s′

1The irrational αis called the slopeofsandρis theintercept. Ifρ= 0, we have
sα,0=acαands′
α,0=bcα,
wherecαis called the characteristic Sturmian word of slopeα(see [2]).
Our focus will be on palindromic factors of cα. In general terms, a palindrome is a ﬁnite word that
reads the same backwards as forwards. Palindromes are importan t tools used in the study of factors
of Sturmian words (e.g., [6, 8, 9, 10]), and they have also become obj ects of great interest in computer
science. The aim of this current paper is to completely describe wher e palindromes occur in cα(and
hencesα,0,s′
α,0). Inordertodothis, weshallmakeuseofsomepreviousresultsco ncerningfactorizations
ofcαintosingular words , which are particular palindromes. Singular words were ﬁrst deﬁned for the
Fibonacci word f(a special example of a Sturmian word) by Wen and Wen [25], who esta blished a
decomposition of fwith respect to such words. This result was later extended by Melan ¸ con [19] to
characteristic Sturmian words. More recently, Lev´ e and S´ e´ eb old [17] have generalized Wen and Wen’s
‘singular’ decomposition of f, by establishing a similar decomposition for each conjugate offinto what
they called generalized singular words . This last result has now been further extended by the present
author [14] to cα(andc1−α), whereαhas continued fraction expansion [0;2 ,r,r,r,... ] for somer≥1.
It is well-known that any Sturmian word sisuniformly recurrent , i.e., any factorof soccurs inﬁnitely
often in swith bounded gaps [5]. Accordingly, any palindromic factor uofcαhas inﬁnitely many
occurrences in cαand, as we shall see later (Corollary 5.2), the distance between any two adjacent
occurrences of uis bounded above by an integer depending on u. Given any palindromic factor uof
cα, we shall establish a decomposition of cαwith respect to the occurrences of u. Such a decomposition
shows precisely at which positions uoccurs incα, and this is directly related to the continued fraction
expansion of the irrational slope α.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, after some preliminar ies on words and morphisms,
we will recall some facts about cαand consider some of its singular decompositions (Section 2.2). Then ,
in Section 3, we consider the structure of palindromic factors of cαwith respect to its singular factors.
We also recall the important notion of a return word and the concep t of overlapping occurrences of a
word incα. Section 4 contains the lemmas we need in order to establish the main r esult of this paper,
which appears in Section 5. Lastly, using results of Section 4, we obt ain decompositions of cαthat
show precisely where a given factor of length qnoccurs incα(whereqnis the denominator of the n-th
convergent to α= [0;1+d1,d2,d3,...],di≥1).
2 Preliminaries
Any of the following terminology that is not further clariﬁed can be fo und in either [18] or [2], which
give more detailed presentations.
2.1 Words and morphisms
In what follows, let Adenote the two-letter alphabet {a,b}. A (ﬁnite) wordis an element of the free
monoidA∗generated by A, in the sense of concatenation. The identity εofA∗is called the empty
word, and the free semigroup overAis deﬁned by A+:=A∗\ {ε}. We denote by Aωthe set of all
inﬁnite words over A, and deﬁne A∞:=A∗∪Aω. Thelength|w|of a ﬁnite word wis deﬁned to be the
number of letters it contains. (Note that |ε|= 0.)
A ﬁnite word zis afactorof a wordw∈ A∞ifw=uzvfor someu∈ A∗andv∈ A∞. Furthermore,
zis called a preﬁx(resp.suﬃx) ofwifu=ε(resp.v=ε), and we write z⊆pw(resp.z⊆sw). The
wordzis said to have an occurrence (or occur) at position |u|ofw=uzv, i.e.,zbegins at the |u|-th
position of w. We denote by |w|zthe number of occurrences of zinw, i.e., the number of distinct
positions at which zoccurs inw. For example, |ababa|aba= 2 sinceabahas two occurrences at positions
0 and 2 inababa.
2For any word w∈ A∞, Ω(w) denotes the set of all factors of w. Moreover, we denote by Ω n(w)
the set of all factors of wof lengthn∈N(wheren≤ |w|forwﬁnite), i.e., Ω n(w) = Ω(w)∩ An. If
u∈Ω(w), then we shall simply write u≺w.
Thereversal operation ∼inA∗is deﬁned inductively by: /tildewideε=εand, for any u∈ A∗andx∈ A,
(/tildewiderux) =x/tildewideu. Thus, ifw=x0x1x2...xn, with each xi∈ A, then/tildewidew=xnxn−1...x1x0. Ifw=/tildewidew, thenw
is called a palindrome , and we deﬁne PAL to be the set of all palindromes over A. It is useful to note
that if|w|is even, then wis a palindrome if and only if w=v/tildewidevfor some word v. Otherwise, wis a
palindrome if and only if w=vx/tildewidevfor some word vand some letter x∈ A.
The free monoid A∗can be naturally embedded within a free group . We shall denote by Fthe free
group generated by A, which contains the inverseu−1of each word u∈ A∗. For anyu,v∈ F, we have
uu−1=u−1u=εand (uv)−1=v−1u−1. Ifu,w∈ A∗, we shall write u−1w(resp.wu−1) only ifuis
a preﬁx (resp. suﬃx) of w, so thatu−1w(resp.wu−1) is a word in A∗. In particular, if w=uv∈ A∗,
thenu−1w=vandwv−1=u, and we have |u−1w|=|w|−|u|=|v|,|wv−1|=|w|−|v|=|u|.
Anendomorphism (or simply morphism ) ofA∗is a mapψ:A∗→ A∗such thatψ(uv) =ψ(u)ψ(v)
for allu,v∈ A∗. It is uniquely determined by its image on the alphabet A. Any morphism ψofA∗can
be uniquely extended to an endomorphism of Fby deﬁning ψ(a−1) = (ψ(a))−1andψ(b−1) = (ψ(b))−1,
from which it follows that ψ(w−1) = (ψ(w))−1for anyw∈ F.
2.1.1 Standard morphisms
Deﬁne the following two morphisms of A∗:
E:a/ma√sto→b
b/ma√sto→a, ϕ:a/ma√sto→ab
b/ma√sto→a.
Amorphism ψofA∗isstandard ifψ(x) isacharacteristicSturmianwordforanycharacteristicSturmian
wordx[2]. In fact, a morphism ψis standard if and only if ψ∈ {E,ϕ}∗, i.e., if and only if it is a
composition of Eandϕin any number and order [7, 2]. The standard morphisms EandϕEwill play
an important role in the proof of our main result.
2.2 Characteristic Sturmian words cαand singular words
Note that every irrational α∈(0,1) has a unique continued fraction expansion
α= [0;a1,a2,a3,...] =1
a1+1
a2+1
a3+···
where each aiis a positive integer. If the sequence ( ai)i≥1is eventually periodic, with ai=ai+mfor all
i≥n, we use the notation α= [0;a1,a2,...,a n−1,an,an+1,...,a n+m−1].Then-th convergent toαis
deﬁned bypn
qn= [0;a1,a2,...,a n],for alln≥1,
where the sequences ( pn)n≥0and (qn)n≥0are given by
p0= 0, p1= 1, pn=anpn−1+pn−2, n≥2;
q0= 1, q1=a1, qn=anqn−1+qn−2, n≥2.
Supposeα= [0;1 +d1,d2,d3,...] withd1≥0 and all other dn>0. To the directive sequence
(d1,d2,d3,...), we associate a sequence ( sn)n≥−1of words deﬁned by
s−1=b, s0=a, sn=sdn
n−1sn−2, n≥1.
3Such a sequence of words is called a standard sequence , and we have
|sn|=qnfor alln≥0.
Note thatabis a suﬃx of s2n−1andbais a suﬃx of s2n, for alln≥1.
Standard sequences are related to characteristic Sturmian word s in the following way. Observe that,
for anyn≥0,snis a preﬁx of sn+1, which gives obvious meaning to lim n→∞snas an inﬁnite word. In
fact, eachsnis a preﬁx of cα, and we have
cα= lim
n→∞sn(see [13, 3]) . (2.1)
2.2.1 Some singular decompositions of cα
Note that if α= [0;1,d1,d2,d3,...], then
1−α=1
1+1/(1/α−1)= [0;1+d1,d2,d3,...]. (2.2)
For any irrational α∈(0,1),E(cα) =c1−α, i.e.,c1−αis obtained from cαby exchanging a’s andb’s
[22]. Thus, in light of the above observation (2.2), we shall hereafte r restrict our attention to the case
whenα= [0;1+d1,d2,d3,...] withd1≥1.
Melan¸ con [19] (also see [4, 25]) has introduced the singular words ( wn)n≥0ofcαdeﬁned by
wn=/braceleftBigg
asnb−1ifnis odd,
bsna−1otherwise.
Moreover, for each n≥ −1, Melan¸ con [19] deﬁned the words
vn=/braceleftBigg
asdn+2−1
n+1snb−1ifnis odd,
bsdn+2−1
n+1sna−1otherwise.
Clearly, the word vndiﬀers from wn+2by a factor sn+1, and it is easily proved that all vnandwnare
palindromes. Here, we will call wn(resp.vn) then-th singular word (resp.n-th adjoining singular word )
ofcα, and use the convention w−2=v−2=ε,w−1=a.
Singular words play an important role in the study of factors of Stur mian words. In particular, as
we shall see in the next section, the words wnandvn−1can be used to determine the structure of all
palindromic factors of a Sturmian word of slope α. We have the following decomposition of cαin terms
of singular and adjoining singular words.
Proposition 2.1. [25, 19]cα=/producttext∞
j=−1(v2jw2j+1)d2j+3=/producttext∞
j=−1vj.
Notation. In order to simplify proceedings, we introduce some notation.
(i) Letγ∈(0,1) be irrational with γ= [0;a1,a2,a3,...]. For any n∈Nand integer ksuch that
k≥1−an+1, deﬁne
γn,k:= [0;an+1+k,an+2,an+3,...]
and writeγn,0=γn. Note that γ0,0=γ= [0;a1,a2,...,a n+γn] for alln≥1.
(ii) Ascαis uniformly recurrent, given any factor wofcα, the occurrences of wincαcan be arranged
as a sequence ( w(i))i≥1, wherew(i)denotes the i-th occurrence of wincα.
With the above notation, we may now state a corollary of Proposition 2.1.
4Corollary 2.2. Letn∈Nbe ﬁxed. The characteristic Sturmian word cαhas the following two decom-
positions:
(1)
cα=
n−1/productdisplay
j=−1(v2jw2j+1)d2j+3
w(1)
2nz1w(2)
2nz2w(3)
2nz3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cα2n+1over the alphabet {v2n−1,w2n+1}.
(2)
cα=
n−1/productdisplay
j=−1(v2jw2j+1)d2j+3
z1W1z2W2z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cα2n+1,1over the alphabet {w2n,v2n−2}and, for all i≥1,
Wi=/braceleftBigg
v2n−1ifzi=w2n,
w2n−1ifzi=v2n−2.
Proof.See [19, Corollary 4.6].
Example 2.1. The best known example of a characteristicSturmian word is the inﬁn iteFibonacci word
f, which has been extensively studied by many authors (see [6, 9], for example). It is well-known that
f= lim
n→∞fn=abaababaabaababaababaabaababaabaab ···,
where (fn)n≥−1is the sequence of ﬁnite Fibonacci words deﬁned by
f−1=b, f0=a, fn=fn−1fn−2, n≥1.
Clearly,|fn|=Fn, whereFnis then-th Fibonacci number deﬁned by
F−1= 1, F0= 1, Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2, n≥1.
Note that ( fn)n≥−1is a standard sequence with associated directive sequence (1 ,1,1,...), and hence
wn=vnfor alln≥ −1. Moreover, in view of (2.1), f=cαwhereα= (3−√
5)/2 = [0;2,1], in which
caseα=α2n+1,1and 1−α=α2n+1, for alln∈N. Hence, f=cα2n+1,1andE(f) =cα2n+1. Accordingly,
one deduces from the above corollary that
f=
n−1/productdisplay
j=−1wj
w(1)
nz1w(2)
nz2w(3)
nz3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is the Fibonacci word over the alphabet {wn+1,wn−1}(also see [25, Theorem 2]).
For instance, when n= 2,wn−1=w1=aa,wn=w2=bab,wn+1=w3=aabaa, andzis the Fibonacci
word over the alphabet {aabaa,aa }. Indeed, one may write
f=abaa(bab)aabaa(bab)aa(bab)aabaa(bab)aabaa(bab)aa(bab)aabaa(bab)aa(bab)aabaa···.
3 Palindromes, return words and overlap
3.1 Structure of palindromes in cα
In [4], Cao and Wen considered the structure of palindromic factors ofcαwith respect to singular words.
Speciﬁcally, they provedthefollowingresultconcerningpalindromicf actorsuofcαwithqn<|u| ≤qn+1.
(For technical reasons, we set q−1= 1, so that |sn|=qnfor alln≥ −1.)
5Proposition 3.1. [4]Letu∈PALwithqn<|u| ≤qn+1for somen∈N. Thenu≺cαif and only if u
takes one of the following forms:
(1)u=vwn/tildewidevwithv⊆svn−1and|v| ≤1
2|vn−1|=1
2(qn+1−qn);
(2)u=vvn−1/tildewidevwithv⊆swnand|v| ≤1
2qn;
(3)u=v(wn−1vn−2)kwn−1/tildewidevwithv⊆svn−2,v/\⌉}atio\slash=vn−2, and0≤k≤dn+1−2;
(4)u=v(vn−2wn−1)kvn−2/tildewidevwithv⊆swn−1,v/\⌉}atio\slash=wn−1, and0≤k≤dn+1−1;
(5)u=wn+1.
Moreover, if k= 0in(3) (resp.(4)), then|v|>1
2|vn−2|=1
2(qn−qn−1) (resp.|v|>1
2qn−1).
Hereafter, we will make frequent use of the following properties of singular words. Some of these
properties may be used without referring to the given lemma.
Lemma 3.2. [19, 4]Letx,y∈ A(x/\⌉}atio\slash=y)withy⊆ssn. Then, for any n∈N,
(1)yx−1wn=ysny−1=wn−1vn−2, wnx−1y=vn−2wn−1;
(2)wn+1=wn−1vn−2vn−1=vn−1vn−2wn−1;
(3)vn−1= (wn−1vn−2)dn+1−1wn−1;
(4)wn+1= (wn−1vn−2)dn+1wn−1;
(5)wn+1=y/producttextn−1
j=−1vj;
(6)wn⊀wn+1;
(7)vn−1⊀wn.
Now, for each n∈Nand 0≤k≤dn+1−1, let us denote by Un,kandUn,kthe palindromes given by
Un,k:= (wn−1vn−2)kwn−1andUn,k:= (vn−2wn−1)kvn−2.
Note thatUn,k=wn−1Un,k(vn−2)−1. Also observe that the singular words ( wn)n≥−1and (vn)n≥−1are
given by
wn−1=Un,0andvn−1=Un,dn+1−1=Un+1,0for alln≥0.
From the preceding proposition and Lemma 3.2, we easily deduce the f ollowing result, which gives
the structure of all palindromic factors of cαin terms of Un,kandUn,k. The proof is left to the reader.
Corollary 3.3. Letu∈PALwith|u| ≥2. Thenuis a factor of cαif and only if, for some n∈N, we
have
u=vUn,k/tildewidev,wherev⊆svn−2,v/\⌉}atio\slash=vn−2and0≤k≤dn+1−2 (3.1)
or
u=vUn,k/tildewidev,wherev⊆swn−1,v/\⌉}atio\slash=wn−1and0≤k≤dn+1−1. (3.2)
Note.Let us point out that U0,0=εandU0,k−1=ak=U0,kfor 1≤k≤d1−1. Therefore, if utakes
the form (3.1) or (3.2) for n= 0, thenu=akfor somek∈[2,d1−1]. So, ifd1≤2, a palindromic factor
ofcαis given by (3.1) or (3.2) for some n≥1.
Remark 3.1. It is important to note that Corollary 3.3 (and also Proposition 3.1) giv es the structure
of all palindromic factors of any Sturmian word of slope α. Indeed, Mignosi [20] proved that any two
Sturmian words s,tof the same slope are equivalent , i.e., Ω(s) = Ω(t). Whence, for any real number ρ,
we have
Ω(sα,ρ) = Ω(s′
α,ρ) = Ω(cα),
i.e., a palindrome is a factor of some Sturmian word of slope αif and only if it is a factor of cα.
63.2 Return words and overlapping occurrences
Let us write cα=x0x1x2···, eachxi∈ A, and letw≺cα. Supposen1< n2< n3<···are all the
natural numbers nisuch thatw=xnixni+1···xni+|w|−1. Then the word xni···xni+1−1is areturn
wordofwincα. That is, we deﬁne the set Rw(cα) of return words of wto be the set of all distinct
words beginning with an occurrence of wand ending exactly before the next occurrence of wincα. This
notion was introduced independently by Durand [11], and Holton and Z amboni [15]. Clearly, Rw(cα) is
ﬁnite since the distance between two adjacent occurrences of wincαis bounded. In fact, Vuillon [24]
has proved that an inﬁnite word soverAis Sturmian if and only if, for any factor wofs, there are
exactly two return words of wins. Suppose Rw(cα) ={u1,u2}. Thencαcan be uniquely factorized
ascα=vui1ui2···uik···, where each ik∈ {1,2}and the ﬁrst occurrence of wincαis at position |v|.
The inﬁnite word Dw(cα) :=ui1ui2···uik···, called the derived word of cαwith respect to w, can be
viewed as an inﬁnite word over the alphabet {u1,u2}. In particular, Dw(cα) is a Sturmian word over
the alphabet Rw(cα) [12]. For example, the return words of wninfarewnwn+1andwnwn−1, and
Dwn(f) is the Fibonacci word over the alphabet {wnwn+1,wnwn−1}(see Example 2.1).
Givenw≺cα, a return word of wincαis not necessarily longer than w, in which case whas
overlapping occurrences in cα. More precisely, if there exist non-empty words u,vandzsuch that
w=uz=zvanduzv≺cα, thenwis said to have overlapincαwithoverlap factor z. Further, one can
writeuzv=wz−1w; whencewhas overlap in cαifwz−1w≺cαfor somez∈ A+. In this case, wz−1is
a return word of cαthat has length less than that of w. Clearly, since any factor wofcαhas exactly
two return words, whas at most two diﬀerent overlap factors.
Return words, and the concept of overlap, are fundamentally impo rtant to our study of occurrences
of palindromes in cα. Indeed, we shall be establishing decompositions of cαwith respect to certain
palindromic factors that have overlap, i.e., palindromic factors uthat have a return word (or return
words) of length(s) less than |u|. Speciﬁcally, given any palindromic factor uofcα, we can write
cα=z0u(1)z1u(2)z2u(3)z3···,
wherez0∈ A∗and all other ziare such that z−1
i∈ A+orzi∈ A∗, according to whether the occurrences
u(i)andu(i+1)do or do not overlap each other, respectively. For instance, if u=wnis then-th singular
factor of the Fibonacci word, then, as shown in Example 2.1, each zi∈ {wn+1,wn−1}(i≥1); in which
caseudoes not have overlap in f.
The following result shows precisely which factors of cαhave no overlapping occurrences in cα.
Proposition 3.4. [4, Theorem 10] Letu≺cαwithqn<|u| ≤qn+1for somen∈N. Thenuhas no
overlap incαif and only if u=wn+1, orwn≺u.
Accordingly, one easily deduces from Proposition 3.1 and Lemma 3.2 wh ich palindromic factors of
cαdo not have overlap.
Corollary 3.5. Letu∈PALandu≺cαwithqn<|u| ≤qn+1for somen∈N. Thenuis a palindrome
without overlap in cαif and only if u=wn+1, oru=vwn/tildewidevwithv⊆svn−1and|v| ≤1
2|vn−1|.
4 Decompositions of cαinto palindromes
In this section, we prove some lemmas which lead us to the main result o f this paper (Theorem 5.1).
4.1 Useful results
In what follows, let us denote by Gthe standard morphism of A∗given by
G=ϕE:a/ma√sto→a
b/ma√sto→ab.
7Lemma 4.1. [22]For any irrational γ∈(0,1),E(cγ) =c1−γandG(cγ) =cγ/(1+γ).
The following simple, yet useful, corollary (and the remark to follow) w ill be needed in our proofs.
Corollary 4.2. For any irrational γ∈(0,1)andk∈N,Gk(cγ) =cγ/(1+kγ).
Proof.Induction on k.
Remark 4.1. Recallthatwearerestrictingourattentionto cαwhereαhascontinuedfractionexpansion
[0;1+d1,d2,d3,...],d1≥1. Let us note thatα
1+kα=1
k+1/α= [0;1+d1+k,d2,d3,...] =α0,kand,
more generally,αn
1+kαn= [0;dn+1+k,dn+2,dn+3,...] forn≥1. Consequently,
Gk(cαn) =cαn,kfor alln≥0.
It is also easily checked that 1 −αn+1,1= [0;1,dn+2,dn+3,...] =αn,1−dn+1, for anyn≥1; whence
E(cαn+1,1) =cαn,1−dn+1for alln≥1. (4.1)
(Note that E(cα1,1) =cα0,−d1.)
4.2 Some lemmas
Here, we simplify Melan¸ con’s decompositions of cα, given in Corollary 2.2. In particular, we obtain two
diﬀerent decompositions of cαwith respect to occurrences of the palindromes
Un,k= (wn−1vn−2)kwn−1andUn,k= (vn−2wn−1)kvn−2(0≤k≤dn+1−1),
which form the basis of all palindromic factors of cα(see Corollary 3.3). From the ﬁrst of these decom-
positions, we easily deduce decompositions of cαthat show exactly where the singular words wnandvn
occur incα, for anyn∈N. (Recall that Corollary 2.2 gives a decomposition of cαwhich shows all of
the occurrences of w2n, but this result does not provide information as to the exact positio ns ofw2n−1
incα.)
Notation. For any morphism ψofA∗such thatψ(a) =uandψ(b) =vfor someu,v∈ A∗, we
shall write ψ= (u,v) to indicate the image of ψon the alphabet A. Ifx=x0x1x2··· ∈ Aω, then
ψ(x) =ψ(x0)ψ(x1)ψ(x2)···is the word obtained from xby replacing the letters aandbinxby the
wordsuandv, respectively. We shall denote by x{u,v}the wordψ(x). In particular, cα{u,v}denotes
the characteristic Sturmian word of slope αover the alphabet {u,v}.

(v2jw2j+1)d2j+3=v2jw2j+1(v2jw2j+1)d2j+3−1=v2j(w2j+1v2j)d2j+3−1w2j+1=v2jv2j+1,
from which the result is readily deduced.
Lemma 4.5. For anyn≥1and0≤k≤dn+1−1, we have
cα=
n−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
U(1)
n,kz1U(2)
n,kz2U(3)
n,kz3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn,−kover the alphabet {(Un,k−1)−1,wn}.
8Note.We setUn,−1= (vn−2)−1andUn,−1= (wn−1)−1; whence if k= 0, then
(Un,k−1)−1= (Un,−1)−1=vn−2and (Un,k−1)−1= (Un,−1)−1=wn−1.
Proof of Lemma 4.5. We ﬁrst prove the result for odd n= 2m+ 1,m≥0. By Corollary 2.2(1) and
Lemma 4.4, we have
cα=
2m−1/productdisplay
j=−1vj
ψ(cα2m+1),
whereψ= (w2mv2m−1,w2mw2m+1). Further, by Remark 4.1, we have
ψGk(cα2m+1,−k) =ψ(cα2m+1) for 0≤k≤d2m+2−1.
Therefore,
cα=
2m−1/productdisplay
j=−1vj
ψGk(cα2m+1,−k),
whereGk= (a,akb), and hence
ψGk= (w2mv2m−1,(w2mv2m−1)kw2mw2m+1)
= (w2mv2m−1,U2m+1,kw2m+1)
= (U2m+1,k(U2m+1,k−1)−1,U2m+1,kw2m+1).
Clearly,U2m+1,kw2m+1andw2mv2m−1(=U2m+1,k(U2m+1,k−1)−1) must be the two return words of
U2m+1,k. Also, using Lemma 3.2, we ﬁnd that U2m+1,kis not a factorof the preﬁx (/producttext2m−1
j=−1vj)U2m+1,k−1
ofcα, since

2m−1/productdisplay
j=−1vj
U2m+1,k−1=x−1w2mv2m−1U2m+1,k−1=x−1U2m+1,k(x∈ A).
Thus, the derived word of cαwith respect to U2m+1,kis given by DU2m+1,k(cα) =
cα2m+1,−k{w2mv2m−1,U2m+1,kw2m+1}, and we can write
cα=
2m−1/productdisplay
j=−1vj
U(1)
2m+1,kz1U(2)
2m+1,kz2U(3)
2m+1,kz3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cα2m+1,−kover the alphabet {(U2m+1,k−1)−1,w2m+1}. This completes
the proof for odd n.
Let us now prove that the assertion holds for even n= 2m,m≥1. By considering occurrences of
U2m−1,d2m−1(=v2m−2) incα, one deduces from the above that, for any integer m≥1,
cα=
2m−3/productdisplay
j=−1vj
v2m−2φ(cα2m−1,1−d2m), (4.2)
whereφ= ((U2m−1,d2m−2)−1v2m−2,w2m−1v2m−2). In fact, using (2) and (3) of Lemma 3.2, we can
writeφ= (v2m−3w2m−2,w2m−1v2m−2) = ((v2m−2)−1w2m,w2m−1v2m−2). Again, using Remark 4.1, we
haveEGk+1(cα2m,−k) =E(cα2m,1) =cα2m−1,1−d2m, whereEGk+1= (b,bk+1a). Whence, it follows from
(4.2) that
cα=
2m−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
φEGk+1(cα2m,−k),
where
φEGk+1= (w2m−1v2m−2,(w2m−1v2m−2)k+1(v2m−2)−1w2m) = (U2m,k(U2m,k−1)−1,U2m,kw2m).
9The result now follows (as for the odd case) since U2m,kw2mandw2m−1v2m−2(=U2m,k(U2m,k−1)−1)
are the two return words of U2m,k.
Remark 4.2. From Lemma 4.5, we readily deduce two ‘singular’ decompositions of cαwith respect to
the occurrences of wnandvn, for anyn∈N. Indeed, we have Un,0=wn−1andUn,dn+1−1=vn−1.
Therefore, taking k= 0 in the above lemma, we obtain a decomposition that shows exactly w here the
n-th singular word wnoccurs incα. That is, for any n≥0,
cα=
n−1/productdisplay
j=−1vj
w(1)
nz1w(2)
nz2w(3)
nz3···, (4.3)
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn+1over the alphabet {vn−1,wn+1}.
Now, taking k=dn+1−1, we ﬁnd that, for any n≥0,
cα=
n−1/productdisplay
j=−1vj
v(1)
nz1v(2)
nz2v(3)
nz3···, (4.4)
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn+2,1over the alphabet {wn+1,(Un+1,dn+2−2)−1}(since
E(cαn+1,1−dn+2) =cαn+2,1). This also holds for n=−1 since, from Lemma 4.3, we have
cα=cα1,1{s1,s0}=cα1,1{ad1b,a}=cα1,1{v−1w0,w−1v−2}.
The following simple decomposition of cα(which has also been proved independently in [4]) is a
direct consequence of (4.4).
Proposition 4.6. For anyn∈N, we have
cα=
n−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
cαn+1,1{vn−1wn,wn−1vn−2}.
Lemma 4.7. For anyn≥1and0≤k≤dn+1−1, we have
cα=
n−3/productdisplay
j=−1vj
U(1)
n,kz1U(2)
n,kz2U(3)
n,kz3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn,1−kover the alphabet {(Un,k−1)−1,(Un−1,dn−2)−1}.
Proof.Follows almost immediately from Proposition 4.6. Indeed, Gk(cαn,1−k) =cαn,1for 0≤k≤
dn+1−1, and hence
cα=
n−3/productdisplay
j=−1vj
cαn,1{vn−2wn−1,wn−2vn−3}=
n−3/productdisplay
j=−1vj
cαn,1−k{vn−2wn−1,(vn−2wn−1)kwn−2vn−3},
wherevn−2wn−1=Un,k(Un,k−1)−1and
(vn−2wn−1)kwn−2vn−3=Un,k(vn−2)−1wn−2vn−3=Un,k(Un−1,dn−2)−1.
105 Main result
We are now equipped with the necessary tools to prove the main resu lt of this paper, which, in view of
Corollary 3.3, completely describes occurrences of palindromes in cα.
Theorem 5.1. Letube a palindromic factor of cαwith|u| ≥2.
(1)Supposeu=vUn,k/tildewidevfor somen≥1, wherev⊆svn−2,v/\⌉}atio\slash=vn−2, and0≤k≤dn+1−2. Then
cα=
n−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
v−1u(1)z1u(2)z2u(3)z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn,−kover the alphabet {(vUn,k−1/tildewidev)−1,/tildewidev−1wnv−1}.
(2)Supposeu=vUn,k/tildewidevfor somen≥1, wherev⊆swn−1,v/\⌉}atio\slash=wn−1, and0≤k≤dn+1−1. Then
cα=
n−3/productdisplay
j=−1vj
v−1u(1)z1u(2)z2u(3)z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn,1−kover the alphabet {(vUn,k−1/tildewidev)−1,(vUn−1,dn−2/tildewidev)−1}.
Moreover, if u=akfor somek∈[2,d1−1], thencα=u(1)z1u(2)z2u(3)z3···, wherez1z2z3···is given
bycα0,−kover the alphabet {(ak−1)−1,b}.
Note.In regards to assertion (1), let us point out that vis a suﬃx (and /tildewidevis a preﬁx) of wnsince
wn=wn−2vn−3vn−2=vn−2vn−3wn−2. Therefore, /tildewidev−1wnv−1∈ A∗since|v|<|vn−2|=qn−qn−1≤
1
2qn=1
2|wn|.
Proof of Theorem 5.1. Assertions (1) and (2) are proved in a similar fashion, using Lemmas 4 .5 and
4.7 respectively, so we just give the proof of (1). The last stateme nt is trivial since cα=Gk(cα0,−k) =
cα0,−k{a,akb}.
Supposeu=vUn,k/tildewidevfor somen≥1, wherev⊆svn−2,v/\⌉}atio\slash=vn−2and 0≤k≤dn+1−2. From
Lemma 4.5, it follows that
cα=
n−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
v−1(vU(1)
n,k/tildewidev)/tildewidev−1z1v−1(vU(2)
n,k/tildewidev)/tildewidev−1z2v−1(vU(3)
n,k/tildewidev)/tildewidev−1z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn,−kover the alphabet {(Un,k−1)−1,wn}. Consequently, since each
occurrence of uincαcorresponds to an occurrence of Un,kincα, we have
cα=
n−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
v−1u(1)ˆz1u(2)ˆz2u(3)ˆz3···,
where ˆzi=/tildewidev−1ziv−1,for alli≥1. (Note that/parenleftBig/producttextn−2
j=−1vj/parenrightBig
v−1∈ A∗sincev⊆svn−2.) Thus, ˆz:=
ˆz1ˆz2ˆz3···is given by cαn,−kover the alphabet {(vUn,k−1/tildewidev)−1,/tildewidev−1wnv−1}. Indeed, ˆzi=/tildewidev−1wnv−1if
zi=wn, and ˆzi=/tildewidev−1(Un,k−1)−1v−1= (vUn,k−1/tildewidev)−1ifzi= (Un,k−1)−1. This completes the proof of
(1).
In part (2), note that/parenleftBig/producttextn−3
j=−1vj/parenrightBig
v−1∈ A∗, sincevis a proper suﬃx of wn−1, and hence a suﬃx of
/producttextn−3
j=−1vj=x−1wn−1, wherex∈ A(by Lemma 3.2(5)).
11Example 5.1. Let us now demonstrate Theorem 5.1 for cαwithα= [0;2,1,3,1] = (4√
5−5)/11. In
this case, we have
cα=abaabaabaababaabaabaabaababaabaabaabaab ···.
Also note that
w−1=v−1=a, w0=v0=b, w1=aa, w2=bab, w 3=aabaabaabaa, v 1=aabaabaa, v 2=bab.
(i) Consider the palindromic factor u=baaw2aab=baababaab , wherev=baa⊆sv1. By Theorem
5.1(1),
cα=v−1v0v1(baa)−1u(1)z1u(2)z2u(3)z3···
=abaabaa(baababaab )z1(baababaab )z2(baababaab )z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cα3over the alphabet {aa,aabaa }. We have cα3=cα3,0=
[0;1,2,1,3] =√
5−57/38, and hence cα3=bbabbbabbba ···. Thus, we can write
cα=abaabaa(baababaab )aabaa(baababaab )aabaa(baababaab )aa(baababaab )aabaa(baababaab )···.
(ii) Now consider the palindromic factor u=U2,1= (w1v0)1w1=aabaa. By Theorem 5.1(1),
cα=v−1v0u(1)z1u(2)z2u(3)z3···=ab(aabaa)z1(aabaa)z2(aabaa)z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cα2,−1over the alphabet {(aa)−1,bab}. We have α2,−1=
[0;2,1,2,1,3] = (4√
5−2)/19, and therefore
cα2,−1=abaabaababaabaabaababaabaabaa ···.
Hence, we can write
cα=ab(aabaa)baabab(aabaa)b(aabaa)bab(aabaa)b(aabaa)bab(aabaa)baa
bab(aabaa)b(aabaa)bab(aabaa)baa···.
Notice that uhas a unique overlap factor aa.
(iii) Let us now consider the palindromic factor u=aU2,2a=a(v0w1)2v0a=abaabaaba , where
a⊆sw1=aa. Observe that
(vU2,1/tildewidev)−1= (a(baa)1ba)−1= (abaaba)−1and (vU1,d2−2/tildewidev)−1= (a(ba)−1ba) =a−1.
Thus, by Theorem 5.1(2), we have
cα=v−1a−1u(1)z1u(2)z2u(3)z3···= (abaabaaba )z1(abaabaaba )z2(abaabaaba )z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cα2,−1over the alphabet {(abaaba)−1,a−1}; whence
cα= (abaabaaba )ab(abaaba[aba)abaaba]ba(aba[abaaba)aba]ba(abaabaa
ba)ba(aba[abaaba)aba]baabaaba ···.
In this case, uhas two overlap factors: abaabaanda.
Let us now denote by occ i(u) the position of the i-th occurrence of uincα, i.e., ifcα=zuxfor
somez∈ A∗,x∈ Aωsuch that |zu|u=i, then occ i(u) =|z|. With this notation, a given factor uofcα
occurs at precisely the positions (occ i(u))i≥1incα.
The following corollary of Theorem 5.1 gives the exact positions at whic h palindromes occur in cα.
12Corollary 5.2. Letube a palindromic factor of cαwith|u| ≥2.
(1)Supposeu=vUn,k/tildewidevfor somen≥1, wherev⊆svn−2,v/\⌉}atio\slash=vn−2, and0≤k≤dn+1−2. Then
occ1(u) =1
2((k+2)qn+qn−1−|u|−2)and, for all i≥1,
occi+1(u) = occ i(u)+Pi,
where(Pi)i≥1is given by cαn,−kover the alphabet {qn,(k+1)qn+qn−1}.
(2)Supposeu=vUn,k/tildewidevfor somen≥1, wherev⊆swn−1,v/\⌉}atio\slash=wn−1, and0≤k≤dn+1−1. Then
occ1(u) =1
2((k+1)qn+qn−1−|u|−2)and, for all i≥1,
occi+1(u) = occ i(u)+Pi,
where(Pi)i≥1is given by cαn,1−kover the alphabet {qn,kqn+qn−1}.
Moreover, if u=akfor somek∈[2,d1−1], thenocc1(u) = 0andocci+1(u) = occ i(u) +Pifor all
i≥1, where(Pi)i≥1is given by cα0,−kover the alphabet {1,k+1}.
Proof.As with Theorem 5.1, the proofs of (1) and (2) are much the same, s o we just give the proof of
(1). The proof of the last statement is trivial.
Supposeu=vUn,k/tildewidevfor somen≥1, wherev⊆svn−2,v/\⌉}atio\slash=vn−2and 0≤k≤dn+1−2. Theorem
5.1(1) shows that
cα=
n−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
v−1u(1)z1u(2)z2u(3)z3···, (5.1)
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn,−kover the alphabet {(vUn,k−1/tildewidev)−1,/tildewidev−1wnv−1}. Observe that
|Un,k|= (k+1)|wn−1|+k|vn−2|= (k+1)qn−1+k(qn−qn−1) =kqn+qn−1,
and hence
|v|=1
2(|u|−|Un,k|) =1
2(|u|−kqn−qn−1).
Also recall that if xis the ﬁrst letter of wn, thenx−1wn=/producttextn−2
j=−1vj. Therefore, since vis a proper
suﬃx ofvn−2, we have
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
n−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
v−1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=|x−1wn|−|v|=qn−1−1
2(|u|−kqn−qn−1).
Hence, the ﬁrst occurrence of uincαis at position
occ1(u) =1
2((k+2)qn+qn−1−|u|−2).
Furthermore,
|vUn,k−1/tildewidev|= (k−1)qn+qn−1+2|v|= (k−1)qn+qn−1+(|u|−kqn−qn−1) =|u|−qn
and
|/tildewidev−1wnv−1|=qn−2|v|=qn−(|u|−kqn−qn−1) = (k+1)qn+qn−1−|u|.
Thus, it follows from (5.1) that occ i+1(u) = occ i(u)+Pifor alli≥1, where (Pi)i≥1is the characteristic
Sturmian word of slope αn,−kover the alphabet {qn,(k+1)qn+qn−1}.
Example 5.2. Letα= [0;2,1,3,1] = (4√
5−5)/11 and consider the palindromic factor uofcαgiven
byu=U2,1=aabaa. According to Corollary 5.2, one should ﬁnd that uﬁrst occurs at position
occ1(u) =1
2(3q2−q1−5−2) =1
2(9+2−7) = 2,
13followed by the positions occ i+1(u) = occ i(u) +Pifor eachi≥1, where (Pi)i≥1is the characteristic
Sturmianwordofslope α2,−1= [0;2,1,2,1,3]overthe alphabet {q2,2q2+q1}={3,8}; that is, (Pi)i≥1=
(3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,...). Indeed, from Example 5.1(2), we have
cα=ab(aabaa)baabab(aabaa)b(aabaa)bab(aabaa)b(aabaa)bab(aabaa)baa
bab(aabaa)b(aabaa)bab(aabaa)baa···,
from which it is evident that u=aabaaoccurs at positions 2, 5, 13, 16, 19, 27, 30, 33, 41, 44, 52, 55,
58, 66,....
Remark 5.1. In general, if u1andu2are the two return words of a factor uofcα, it is clear that
occi+1(u) = occ i(u)+|uji|whereji= 1 or 2.
In particular, the sequence ( ji)i≥1is a Sturmian word over the alphabet {1,2}(see [12] or Section 3.2).
In the case when uis a palindromic factor of cα, Corollary 5.2 shows that the sequence ( ji)i≥1is given
bycαn,−kover the alphabet {1,2}, for somen∈Nand 0≤k≤dn+1−1. For example, the two return
words ofwn(=Un+1,0) areu1=wnvn−1andu2=wnwn+1, where
|u1|=qn+1and|u2|=qn+1+qn.
From Corollary 5.2, occ 1(wn) =qn+1−1 and occ i+1(wn) = occ i(wn)+|uji|for eachi≥1, where (ji)i≥1
is given by cαn+1over the alphabet {1,2}.
6 Occurrences of factors of length qnincα
In this last section, we determine the structure of all factors of le ngthqnofcαwith respect to the
singular words wn,wn−1, andvn−2. Subsequently, using some results from Section 4, we completely
describe where factors of length qnoccur incα.
Letw=x1x2···xm∈ A∗, eachxi∈ A, and letk∈Nwith 0≤k≤m−1. Thek-th conjugate ofw
is the word Ck(w) :=xk+1xk+2···xmx1x2···xk. Further, we conventionally set C−k(w) =C|w|−k(w)
and deﬁneC(w) :={Ck(w) : 0≤k≤ |w|−1}.
One can easily prove that any conjugate of snis a factor of cα. Certainly, C(s−1) ={b}and, for
n≥0,
sn+3=sdn+3
n+2sn+1= (sdn+2
n+1sn)dn+3sdn+1
nsn−1= (sdn+2
n+1sn)dn+3−1sdn+2
n+1sdn+1+1
nsn−1,
wheredn+1+1≥2. Thus,s2
nis a factor of cα, and hence the claim is proved since any conjugate of sn
is a factor of s2
n.
Now, each snis a primitive word [8], i.e., sncannot be written as a non-trivial integer power of a
shorter word. Consequently, snhasqndistinct conjugates, i.e., |C(sn)|=qn. Furthermore, from the
above observation, C(sn) is a set of factors of cα. It is therefore deduced that the set of all factors of
lengthqnofcαconsists ofC(sn) andwn. That is,
Ωqn(cα) =C(sn)∪{wn}.
Indeed, since cαis a Sturmian word, it must have exactly qn+1 distinct factors of length qn.
Lemma 6.1. For anyn≥1,Cqn−1(sn) =wn−1vn−2andCqn−1−1(sn) =vn−2wn−1. Moreover,
(1)for0≤k≤qn−1−2,Ck(sn) =uvn−2v, wherevu=wn−1and|v|=k+1;
(2)forqn−1−1≤k≤qn−1,Ck(sn) =uwn−1v, wherevu=vn−2and|v|=k+1−qn−1.
Proof.By Lemma 3.2(1), C−1(sn) =Cqn−1(sn) =wn−1vn−2. Therefore, Cqn−1−1(sn) =vn−2wn−1
since|wn−1|=qn−1. Assertions (1) and (2) follow immediately.
14Accordingly, a factor of length qnofcαis eitherwn, or has at least one of the words vn−2and
wn−1as a factor. We shall now establish two diﬀerent decompositions of cα, which show exactly where
conjugates of snoccur incα.
Theorem 6.2. Letn≥1.
(1)Supposew=Ck(sn)for somek∈[0,qn−1−2], so thatw=uvn−2v, wherevu=wn−1and
|v|=k+1. Then
cα=
n−3/productdisplay
j=−1vj
u−1w(1)z1w(2)z2w(3)z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn,1over the alphabet {ε,(uUn−1,dn−2v)−1}.
(2)Supposew=Ck(sn)for somek∈[qn−1−1,qn−1], so thatw=uwn−1v, wherevu=vn−2and
|v|=k+1−qn−1. Then
cα=
n−2/productdisplay
j=−1vj
u−1w(1)z1w(2)z2w(3)z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαnover the alphabet {ε,v−1wnu−1}.
Proof.Using decompositions (4.4) and (4.3) (consequences of Lemma 4.5), the proof follows along
exactly the same lines as the proof of Theorem 5.1.
In light of Theorem 6.2 and the wn-decomposition of cαgiven by (4.3) (together with the fact that
Ωqn(cα) =C(sn)∪ {wn}), we have now shown precisely where each factor of length qnoccurs incα.
It is important to note that it follows from Proposition 3.4 that a fact orwof lengthqndoes not have
overlap incαif and only if w=wn, orw=Ck(sn) for somek∈[qn−1−1,qn−1]. Certainly, if wtakes
the latter form, then w=uwn−1vwithvu=vn−2and|v|=k+1−qn−1. In this case, Theorem 6.2(2)
shows that wdoes not have overlapping occurrences since wn= (vu)vn−3wn−2=wn−2vn−3(vu), where
vu=vn−2, and hence v−1wnu−1∈ A∗.
Example 6.1. Supposeα= [0;2,1] = (√
3−1)/2. Then
cα=abaabaababaabaabaababaabaabaababaabaababaabaabaabab aabaabaababa ···.
Let us demonstrate the above theorem by considering the ﬁrst tw o conjugates of s3=abaabaab ; namely,
C1(s3) (=Cq2−2(s3)) andC2(s3) (=Cq2−1(s3)). First observe that
w−1=v−1=a, w0=v0=b, w1=aa, w2=bab, w 3=aabaabaa, v 1=aabaa, v 2=bab.
(1) Letw=C1(s3); the ﬁrst conjugate of s3. We have w=baabaaba =uv1v, whereu=b,v=ba
andvu=bab=w2. Hence, by Theorem 6.2(1),
cα=v−1v0b−1w(1)z1w(2)z2w(3)z3···=a(baabaaba )z1(baabaaba )z2(baabaaba )z3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cα3,1over the alphabet {ε,(baaba)−1}. (Note that
(uU2,d3−2v)−1= (b(aab)0aaba)−1= (baaba)−1.) Sinceα3,1= [0;2,2,1] = 1−√
3/3, we have
cα3,1=ababaabababaab ···, and thus we can write
cα=a(baabaaba )(baabaaba )aba(baabaaba )aba(baabaaba )(baabaaba )aba
(baabaaba )aba(baabaaba )aba(baabaaba )(baabaaba )aba···.
(2) Now let w=C2(s3); the second conjugate of s3. Thenw=aabaabab =v1w2, and it follows from
Theorem 6.2(2) that
cα=v−1v0v1v1−1w(1)z1w(2)z2w(3)z3···=ab(aabaabab )z1(aabaabab )z2(aabaabab )z3···,
15wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cα3over the alphabet {ε,w3(aabaa)−1}={ε,aab}. Note that
α3= [0;1,2] =√
3−1, and hence cα3=bbabbbabbba ···. Therefore,
cα=ab(aabaabab )aab(aabaabab )aab(aabaabab )(aabaabab )aab(aabaabab )
aab(aabaabab )aab(aabaabab )(aabaabab )aab(aabaabab )aab···.
Remark 6.1. From Theorem 6.2, one can easily deduce Lemma 4.3 (i.e., cα=cαn,1{sn,sn−1}for all
n≥1), as follows. Observe that sn=C0(sn) =uvn−2v, whereu=y−1wn−1andv=y. Similarly,
sn−1=x−1wn−2vn−3x, wherex∈ A(x/\⌉}atio\slash=y). Hence,
cα=
n−3/productdisplay
j=−1vj
(y−1wn−1)−1s(1)
nz1s(2)
nz2s(3)
nz3···=s(1)
nz1s(2)
nz2s(3)
nz3···,
wherez:=z1z2z3···is given by cαn,1over the alphabet {ε,(y−1wn−1Un−1,dn−2y)−1}. That is,
cα=cαn,1{sn,sn(y−1wn−1(wn−2vn−3)−1vn−2y)−1}.
Using Lemma 3.2, we have
sn(y−1wn−1(wn−2vn−3)−1vn−2y)−1=sn(sn−1x−1(wn−2vn−3)−1vn−2y)−1
=sny−1(vn−2)−1(wn−2vn−3)x(sn−1)−1
=x−1wn(vn−2)−1xsn−1(sn−1)−1
=x−1wn−2vn−3x
=sn−1,
and therefore cα=cαn,1{sn,sn−1}, as required.
We ﬁnish with a corollary of Theorem 6.2 ( cf.Corollary 5.2).
Corollary 6.3. Letn≥1and suppose w=Ck(sn)for somek∈[0,qn−1]. Thenocc1(w) =kand,
for alli≥1,occi+1(w) = occ i(w)+Pi, where(Pi)i≥1is given by:
•cαn,1over the alphabet {qn,qn−1}ifk∈[0,qn−1−2],or
•cαnover the alphabet {qn,qn+qn−1}ifk∈[qn−1−1,qn−1].
