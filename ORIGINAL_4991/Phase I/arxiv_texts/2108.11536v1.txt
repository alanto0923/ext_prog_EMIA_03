SOPHIE ZHU
Abstract. Forα∈R>0, letN0[α,α−1] be the semiring of real numbers f(α) with
allf(x)∈N0[x,x−1], whereN0is the set of nonnegative integers and N0[x,x−1] is the
semiring of Laurent polynomials with coeﬃcients in N0. In this paper, we study var-
ious factorization properties of the additive structure of N0[α,α−1]. We characterize
whenN0[α,α−1]isatomic. Thenwecharacterizewhen N0[α,α−1]satisﬁesthe ascend-
ing chain condition on principal ideals in terms of certain well-studied fa ctorization
properties. Finally, we characterize when N0[α,α−1] satisﬁes the unique factorization
property and show that, when this is not the case, N0[α,α−1] has inﬁnite elasticity.
1.Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to understand the (additive) factoriz ation properties
of the commutative semirings N0[α,α−1] for any α∈R>0. To be more precise, let
N0[x,x−1] denote the set of Laurent polynomials with coeﬃcients in the set of nonneg-
ative integers N0. SinceN0[x,x−1] is closed under both addition and multiplication, it
is a commutative semiring. For each α∈R>0, we letMαdenote the additive monoid
of the semiring N0[α,α−1], that is,
Mα={f(α)|f(x)∈N0[x,x−1]}.
It is a sub-semiring of the commutative semiring R≥0. For ease of notation, we shall use
Mαin this paper to denote the additive monoid of the semiring N0[α,α−1] forα∈R>0.
LetMbe a cancellative and commutative (additive) monoid. A non-invertible element
ofMis called an atom if it is not the sum of two non-invertible elements, and M
is atomic if every non-invertible element is a sum of atoms. It is well-kno wn that
every commutative (and cancellative) monoid satisfying the ascend ing chain condition
on principal ideals (ACCP) is atomic (see, for example, [ 11, Proposition 1.1]). As
for integral domains, Mis called a unique factorization monoid (UFM) provided that
every non-invertible element can be written as a sum of atoms in an es sentially unique
way (i.e., up to order and associates). Here, we study the propert ies of being atomic,

satisfying the ACCP, and being a UFM for the additive monoids Mα(withα∈R>0),
oﬀering various characterizations for each of such properties in t erms of atoms and
(additive) factorizations.
Most of the results we establish here are motivated by some of the r esults in the re-
cent paper [ 12] by Correa-Morris and Gotti, where the authors investigated the atomic
structure of the additive monoids of the evaluation semirings N0[α] forα∈R>0, gen-
eralizing some of the results already established by Chapman et al. in [ 9] whenαis
taken in Q>0. The study of atomicity and factorizations in the setting of commut ative
semirings has received a great deal of attention in the last few year s. For instance,
Campanini and Facchini [ 6] studied the factorization structure of the multiplicative
monoid of the semiring N0[x]. In addition, Baeth et al. [ 4] recently studied the atomic
structure of both the additive and the multiplicative monoids of subs emirings of R≥0.
Finally, factorizations in certain subsemirings of Q≥0have also been considered in [ 1]
by Albizu-Campos et al. and in [ 5] by Baeth and Gotti.
We begin by introducing the main terminology in Section 2.1and outlining the
main known results we use later. Then, in Section 3, we discuss the atomicity of the
monoids Mα.We characterize the monoids Mαthat are atomic as well those Mαthat
are not atomic in Theorem 3.1and Proposition 3.4, respectively. In contrast with [ 12,
Proposition 5.13], the monoid Mαis only ﬁnitely generated when α= 1.In particular,
ifα/\e}atio\slash= 1 and the monoid Mαis atomic, then Mαmust contain inﬁnitely many atoms;
indeed, we show in Theorem 3.1that the atoms of Mαare precisely the integer powers
ofα.
LetMbe an atomic (additive) monoid. A factorization of a non-invertible ele ment
x∈Mis, up to order and associates, a sequence of ﬁnitely many atoms (a llowing
repetitions) with sum x, and the number of atoms in such a sequence (counting rep-
etitions) is called the the length of the factorization. A non-invertib le element in M
may have distinct factorizations (even inﬁnitely many). For a non-in vertible element
x∈M, we letZ(x) andL(x) denote the set of factorizations and factorization lengths
ofx, respectively. Following Anderson et al. [ 2] and Halter-Koch [ 23], we say that
the monoid Mis an FFM (resp., a BFM) provided that Z(x) (resp., L(x)) is ﬁnite
for all non-invertible x∈M. The property of being a BFM was ﬁrst studied back in
1949 by Neumann [ 24] in connection to the ACCP. Note that every FFM is a BFM.
In Section 4, we prove that the conditions of satisfying the ACCP, being a BFM, a nd
being an FFM are equivalent for any monoid Mα(see Theorem 4.3). In addition, we
construct monoids Mαthat are FFMs but not UFMs (see Subsection 4.2).
In Section 5, we identify the monoids Mαthat are UFMs. Following Zaks [ 28], we
say thatMisa half-factorialmonoid(HFM) if L(x) is asingleton for every x∈M. The
property of being an HFM was ﬁrst considered by Carlitz [ 7] in the context of algebraic
number theory to characterize rings of integers with class number two. Following
Chapman et al. [ 8], we say that Mis called a length-factorial monoid (LFM) if forEVALUATION MONOIDS OF LAURENT SEMIRINGS 3
everyx∈M, not two factorizations in Z(x) have the same length. Additionally, in
Section5, we prove that the conditions of being a UFM, an HFM, and an LFM are
equivalent for any monoid Mα.
It is not hard to argue that classes satisfying the atomic propertie s we have just
deﬁned are somehow nested, as indicated by the following chain of imp lications in
Diagram ( 1.1). In Section 5, we produce a diagram (Diagram ( 5.1)) specialized for the
class of all monoids Mαthat reﬁnes Diagram ( 1.1).
(1.1) UFM⇒[FFM, HFM ]⇒BFM⇒ACCP ⇒atomicity
The elasticity of a monoid is an arithmetic statistic that measures how much a
monoid deviates from being an HFM. The elasticity was ﬁrst considere d by Steﬀan [ 25]
and Valenza [ 27] back in the eighties to understand how far from being a UFD is a
Dedekind domain or a ring of integers, respectively. Since then the e lasticity has
become probably the most studied arithmetic invariant to measure n on-uniqueness of
factorizations (see [ 29] by Zhong, and references therein). We conclude this paper with
showing that Mαhas inﬁnite elasticity when it is not an HFM (see Proposition 5.4),
which means that either Mαis an HFM or it is as far from being an HFM as a monoid
can possibly be.
2.Background
2.1.General Notation. We letP,N, andN0denote the set of primes, positive in-
tegers, and nonnegative integers, respectively. If Xis a subset of Randris a real
number, we let X≥rdenote the set {x∈X|x≥r}. Similarly, we use the notations
X>r,X≤r, andX<r. For a positive rational q, the positive integers aandbwithq=a/b
and gcd( a,b) = 1 are denoted by n(q) andd(q), respectively.
Givenamonicpolynomial f(x)∈Q[x], letℓbethesmallestpositiveintegersuchthat
ℓ·f(x)∈Z[x]. Then there exist unique p(x),q(x)∈N0[x] such that ℓf(x) =p(x)−q(x)
and that p(x) andq(x) share no monomials of the same degree (that is, the greatest
common divisor of p(x) andq(x) in the free commutative monoid ( N0[x],+) is 0).
We call the pair ( p(x),q(x)) theminimal pair off(x). In addition, if αis a real
algebraicnumber, the minimal pair of αis deﬁned tobetheminimal pairof itsminimal
polynomial over Q.4 S. ZHU
2.2.Monoids. Amonoidis a cancellative and commutative semigroup with an iden-
tity element. Monoids here will be written additively, unless we say oth erwise. Let M
be a monoid. An element x∈Mis called invertible (or aunit) if there exists y∈M
such that x+y= 0. We tacitly assume that M(and every monoid we deal with here)
isreduced; that is, its only invertible element is 0. We set M•=M\{0}. For a subset
SofM, we let/a\}bracketle{tS/a\}bracketri}htdenote the submonoid of Mgenerated by S, i.e., the intersection of
all submonoids of Mcontaining S. We say that a monoid is ﬁnitely generated if it can
be generated by a ﬁnite set. A nonzero element a∈Mis called an atomif whenever
a=x+yfor some x,y∈Meitherx= 0 ory= 0. It is customary to let A(M) denote
the set consisting of all atoms of M, and we do so. If A(M) is empty, Mis said to be
antimatter . The monoids we are mostly interested in this paper are atomic.
Deﬁnition 2.1. An (additive) monoid is atomicif every nonzero element can be writ-
ten as a sum of atoms.
IfIis a subset of M, thenIis called an idealprovided that I+M=I(or,
equivalently, I+M⊆I). Every subset of Mof the form x+M, wherex∈M, is
an ideal and is called a principal ideal. The monoid Msatisﬁes the ascending chain
condition on principal ideals (ACCP) if every increasing sequence (under inclusion)
of principal ideals of Mbecomes stationary from one point on. It is well known that
every monoid satisfying the ACCP is atomic (see [ 15, Proposition 1.1.4]). The converse
does not hold: for instance, the additive submonoid /a\}bracketle{t(2
3)n|n∈N/a\}bracketri}htofQis an atomic
monoid that does not satisfy the ACCP [ 10, Corollary 4.4].
2.3.Factorizations. Assume now that Mis atomic. Let Z(M) denote the free (com-
mutative) monoid on the set A(M). For each x∈M, we let Z(x) denote the set
of all formal sums z:=a1+···+aℓ∈Z(M) witha1,...,a ℓ∈A(M) such that
a1+···+aℓ=xinM. In this case, ℓis called the lengthofzand is denoted by |z|.
For each x∈M, we set L(x) :={|z| |z∈Z(x)}. The sets Z(x) andL(x) play an
important role in factorization theory (see [ 14]). Note that Mis atomic if and only if
Z(x) is nonempty for all x∈M•.
The monoid Mis called a bounded factorization monoid (BFM) if L(x) is ﬁnite for
allx∈M. Every BFM satisﬁes the ACCP [ 15, Corollary 1.3.3], but the converse
does not hold: /a\}bracketle{t1/p|p∈P/a\}bracketri}htsatisﬁes the ACCP but is not a BFM [ 10, Corollary 4.6].
The monoid Mis called a half-factorial monoid (HFM) if |L(x)|= 1 for all x∈M•.
Observe that every HFM is a BFM. The monoid Mis called a ﬁnite factorization
monoid) (FFM) if Z(x) is ﬁnite for all x∈M•. Every ﬁnitely generated monoid is
an FFM [ 3, Corollary 3.7]. Note that every FFM is a BFM; however, {0} ∪Q≥1is
a BFM that is not an FFM [ 10, Example 4.10]. In addition, one can see that /a\}bracketle{t2,3/a\}bracketri}ht
is an FFM that is not an HFM. On the other hand, there are HFMs that are not
FFMs; this is the case of the additive monoid {(0,0)}∪(Z×N) (see [3, Example 3.9]).
Finally,Mis called a unique factorization monoid (UFM) provided that |Z(x)|= 1 forEVALUATION MONOIDS OF LAURENT SEMIRINGS 5
allx∈M•. Every UFM is, by deﬁnition, both an HFM and an FFM. Then we see tha t
each implication in Diagram ( 1.1) holds and that such a diagram does not support, in
general, any additional implication.
3.Atomicity
In this section, we study the atomicity of the additive monoids Mα, whereMα=
N0[α,α−1] forα∈R>0. We characterize the monoids Mαthat are atomic, and then we
give examples of monoids Mαthat are atomic but do not satisfy the ACCP. The next
theorem, which gives a simple characterization of the monoids Mαthat are atomic, also
providesanexplicitdescriptionofthesetofatomsof Mα. Moreover, itgivesanecessary
conditionfor theatomicityof Mαwhenαisalgebraic. Forany algebraicnumber αwith
minimal polynomial m(x)∈Q[x], the polynomial ℓ·m(x) is a primitive polynomial in
Z[x] for a unique ℓ∈N, soℓ·m(x) =p(x)−q(x) for unique p(x),q(x)∈N0[x] that do
not share monomials of equal degrees. We call ( p(x),q(x)) the minimal pair of α(see
Section2.1).
Theorem 3.1. For each α∈R>0,the following statements are equivalent.
(a) 1∈A(Mα).
(b)A(Mα) ={αn|n∈Z}.
(c)Mαis atomic.
Suppose that α∈R>0\{1}is an algebraic number. If Mαis atomic, then neither of
the two components in the minimal pair of αis a monic monomial.
Proof.(a)⇒(b): Suppose that A(Mα)/\e}atio\slash={αn|n∈Z}. Then there exists n∈Z
such that αn/\e}atio\slash∈A(Mα) and, therefore, there exists a ﬁnite set S⊂Zsuch that
αn=/summationtext
i∈Sciαifor some coeﬃcients ci∈Nfor each i∈Ssuch that/summationtext
i∈Sci≥2.
Dividing by αngives 1 =/summationtext
i∈Sciαi−n.Thus, 1/\e}atio\slash∈A(Mα),as desired.
(b)⇒(c): This holds by the deﬁnition of Mα.
(c)⇒(a): Suppose 1 /\e}atio\slash∈A(Mα).Then there exists a ﬁnite set S⊂Zand coeﬃcients
ci∈Nfor eachi∈Ssuch that/summationtext
i∈Sci≥2 and 1 =/summationtext
i∈Sciαi.For each k∈Z, we can
multiplying both sides of 1 =/summationtext
i∈Sciαibyαkto obtain the equality αk=/summationtext
i∈Sciαi+k.
Thus,αkis not an atom for any k∈Z, which implies that Mαhas no atoms and,
therefore, that it is not atomic.
Assume now that αis a positive algebraic real number such that α/\e}atio\slash= 1. Let m(x)
and (p(x),q(x)) be the minimal polynomial and the minimal pair of α, respectively.
Suppose, by way of contradiction, that either p(x) orq(x) is a monic monomial. We
can say, without loss of generality, that q(x) =xnfor some n∈N0. Thus,p(α)−αn=
p(α)−q(α) =ℓm(α) = 0 for some ℓ∈N,sop(α) =αn. Because α/\e}atio\slash= 1, we
see that p(x) must be the sum of at least two nonzero monomials (not necessarily6 S. ZHU
distinct). Consequently, αn/∈A(Mα). Therefore, Mαis not atomic in light of the
characterizations established above, which yields the desired cont radiction. /square
It is worth mentioning that, as a direct consequence of Theorem 3.1, one obtains
that every monoid Mαsatisﬁes|A(Mα)| ∈ {0,∞}and also that Mαis either atomic or
antimatter. In addition, when αis transcendental, Mαis atomic, as we now illustrate.
Corollary 3.2. Ifα∈R>0is transcendental, then Mαis atomic.
Proof.Suppose that 1 =/summationtext
i∈Sciαifor a ﬁnite set S⊆Zand coeﬃcients ci∈N0for
everyi∈S. Thenαwould be a root of the polynomial f(x) :=xm−/summationtext
i∈Scixi+m∈
Z[x], wherem=−min({0}∪S). Sinceαis transcendental, f(x) is the zero polynomial
and, therefore, S={0}andc0= 1. Hence 1 ∈A(Mα), andMαis atomic by
Theorem 3.1. /square
It is worth emphasizing that the necessary condition in Theorem 3.1is not suﬃcient;
this is illustrated in the following example.
Example 3.3. Consider themonic polynomial m(x) =x3−2x2+3x−7. Because m(x)
has no integer roots, it follows fromGauss’s lemma that m(x) is irreducible in Q[x]. On
the other hand, m(2) =−1 andm(3) = 11, the polynomial m(x) has a positive root α
in the interval (2 ,3). Consider the monoid Mα. Asm(x)(x+2) =x4−x2−x−14, we
see thatαis a root of the polynomial x4−x2−x−14, soα4=α2+α+14. Hence αis
not an atom of Mα, and it follows from the characterization in Theorem 3.1thatMα
is not atomic. However, none of the polynomials in the minimal pair ( x3+3x,2x2+7)
ofαare monic monomials. Therefore we conclude that the necessary co ndition in
Theorem 3.1is not suﬃcient.
Ifα= 1, then Mα=N0, which is atomic. On the other hand, if α∈N≥2(or if
α= 1/nfor some n∈N≥2), then 1 is the sum of αcopies of α−1(resp.,α−1copies of
α) and, therefore 1 /∈A(Mα), and so Theorem 3.1ensures that Mαis not atomic. In
addition, we have exhibited in Example 3.3a monoid Mαthat is not atomic for some
α∈R>0\Q. We now characterize the monoids Mαthat are not atomic.
Proposition 3.4. Forα∈R>0withα/\e}atio\slash= 1, the following statements are equivalent.
(a)Mαis not atomic.
(b) (N0[α],+)is antimatter or ﬁnitely generated.
Proof.(a)⇒(b): Suppose that Mαis not atomic. Then αis algebraic as otherwise
Mαwould be a free commutative monoid, which is atomic. We consider the f ollowing
two cases.
Case 1:α <1. SinceMαis not atomic, 1 /∈A(Mα) by Theorem 3.1, so we can write
1 =/summationtextn
i=1ciαifor some n∈Nandc1,...,c n∈N0(here, we use that α <1). Then 1 is
not an atom of the additive monoid N0[α], and it follows from [ 12, Theorem 4.1] that
N0[α] is antimatter.EVALUATION MONOIDS OF LAURENT SEMIRINGS 7
Case 2: α >1. Since 0 is not a limit point of N0[α]•(because α >1), it follows
from [21, Proposition 4.5] that N0[α] is atomic. As in the case already considered, the
fact that Mαis not atomic allows us to write 1 =/summationtextn
i=1ciα−ifor some n∈Nand
c1,...,c n∈N0(here, we use that α >1). Therefore αn=/summationtextn
i=1ciαn−i. AsN0[α] is
an atomic monoid, the inclusion A(N0[α])⊆ {αk|k∈ {0,...,n−1}}holds by [ 12,
Theorem 4.1]. Thus, N0[α] is ﬁnitely generated.
(b)⇒(a): Note that αis algebraic, for otherwise, N0[α] would be a free commuta-
tive monoid on a countable basis, which is neither antimatter nor ﬁnite ly generated.
Suppose ﬁrst that the additive monoid N0[α] is antimatter. Since the set {αn|n∈N0}
generates N0[α], the equality 1 =/summationtextk
i=1ciαiholds for some k∈Nandc1,...,c k∈N0.
Hence 1 /∈A(Mα), and so Mαis not atomic by Theorem 3.1.
Finally, suppose that the additive monoid N0[α] is ﬁnitely generated. Then N0[α] is
atomic by [ 15, Proposition 2.7.8], and it follows from [ 12, Theorem 4.1] that
A(N0[α]) ={αk|k∈ {0,...,n−1}}
for some n∈N. Sinceα/\e}atio\slash= 1, we see that n≥2. Then αn=/summationtextn−1
k=0ckαkfor some
c0,...,c n−1∈N0, which means that 1 =/summationtextn−1
k=0ckαk−n. Hence 1 /∈A(Mα), and it
follows from Theorem 3.1thatMαis not atomic. /square
We conclude this section with examples of monoids Mαthat are atomic but do not
satisfy the ACCP.
Example 3.5. Takea,b∈Nwith gcd( a,b) = 1 such that 1 < a < b, and set α=a/b.
It follows from [ 20, Proposition 3.5] that the monoid Mαis atomic. On the other
hand, we claim that Mαdoes not satisfy the ACCP. By [ 10, Corollary 4.4], there is
an ascending chain ( xn+N0[α])n∈Nof principal ideals of the monoid ( N0[α],+) that
does not stabilize. From the fact that Mαis a reduced monoid having ( N0[α],+) as
a submonoid, we can deduce that the chain of principal ideals ( xn+Mα)n∈NofMα
cannot stabilize in Mα,showing that Mαdoes not satisfy the ACCP.
4.The Ascending Chain Condition on Principal Ideals
We have just seen in the previous section that satisfying the ACCP is a stronger
condition than being atomic when restricted to the class consisting o f the monoids Mα.
In this section, we provide two necessary conditions for a monoid Mαto satisfy the
ACCP, and then we establish two factorization-theoretical chara cterizations: satisfying
the ACCP is equivalent to both the bounded factorization property and the ﬁnite
factorization property if one restricts attention to the class con sisting of all monoids
Mα. We conclude this section by constructing monoids Mαsatisfying the ACCP that
are not UFMs.8 S. ZHU
Proposition 4.1. Letα∈(0,1)be an algebraic number with minimal pair (p(x),q(x)).
IfMαsatisﬁes the ACCP, then p(x)−Q(x)q(x)/∈N0[x,x−1]for any nonzero Laurent
polynomial Q(x)∈N0[x,x−1].
Proof.Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a nonz ero Laurent
polynomial Q(x)∈N0[x,x−1] such that r(x) :=p(x)−Q(x)q(x)∈N0[x,x−1]. Now
consider the sequences ( an)n∈Nand (bn)n∈Ndeﬁned by
an=Q(α)nq(α) and bn:=Q(α)nr(α),
respectively, for every n∈N. Observe that the terms of both ( an)n∈Nand (bn)n∈Nare
nonzero elements in Mα. On the other hand,
an=Q(α)nq(α) =Q(α)np(α) =Q(α)n+1q(α)+Q(α)nr(α) =an+1+bn
for every n∈N. Therefore ( an+Mα)n∈Nis an ascending chain of principal ideals of
Mα. Sincean−an+1=bn>0 for every n∈N, the chain of ideals ( an+Mα)n∈Ndoes
not stabilize, contradicting that Mαsatisﬁes the ACCP. /square
In Example 3.5, we saw that Mαis an atomic monoid that does not satisfy the
ACCP for most choices of q∈Q>0. However, there are also some examples of irrational
algebraic real numbers αsuch that Mαis atomic but does not satisfy the ACCP, and
we can identify some of them using Proposition 4.1.
Example 4.2. Takea,b∈Nsuch that gcd( a,b) = 1 and 1 < a < b . Assume,
in addition, that aandbare not perfect squares, and then set α:=/radicalbig
a/b. Then
αis a non-rational algebraic number with minimal polynomial m(x) :=x2−a/b.
Suppose, by way of contradiction, that Mαis not atomic. By Theorem 3.1, we can
takec1,...,c n∈N0such that 1 = c1α+···+cnαn. Sinceαis a root of the polynomial
f(x) :=cnxn+···+c1x−1∈Z[x], there exists a polynomial g(x)∈Q[x] such
thatf(x) =m(x)g(x). By Gauss’s lemma, there exists q∈Q>0such that m′(x) :=
qm(x)∈Z[x] andg′(x) :=q−1g(x)∈Z[x]. Since qm(x) has integer coeﬃcients,
q∈bN. Therefore a|m′(0), soa|m′(0)g′(0) =f(0) = 1, a contradiction. Thus, Mα
is atomic. Let us argue now that Mαdoes not satisfy the ACCP. Since αhas minimal
pair (p(x),q(x)) := (bx2,a), forQ(x) :=x2we see that p(x)−Q(x)q(x) = (b−a)x2,
which belongs to N0[x,x−1]. Hence Mαdoes not satisfy the necessary condition in
Proposition 4.1, and so it does not satisfy the ACCP.
4.1.The Bounded and Finite Factorization Properties. In this subsection we
prove that in the context of the monoids Mα, satisfying the ACCP, being a BFM, and
being an FFM are equivalent properties. Recall that a monoid Mis a BFM (resp., an
FFM) provided that L(x) (resp.,Z(x)) is ﬁnite for all x∈M•. We proceed to establish
the main result of this section.
Theorem 4.3. Forα∈R>0,the following statements are equivalent.EVALUATION MONOIDS OF LAURENT SEMIRINGS 9
(a)Mαis an FFM.
(b)Mαis a BFM.
(c)Mαsatisﬁes the ACCP.
Proof.(a)⇒(b): This follows from the deﬁnitions of a BFM and an FFM.
(b)⇒(c): This is a special case of [ 15, Corollary 1.3.3].
(c)⇒(a): Suppose that the monoid Mαsatisﬁes the ACCP. If αis transcendental,
thenMαis a free commutative monoid, and thus an FFM. We assume, therefo re, that
αis algebraic.
Suppose, by way of contradiction, that Mαis not an FFM. Then α/\e}atio\slash= 1 and, after
replacing αbyα−1if necessary, we canassume that α >1. SinceMαis notanFFM,we
can choose β∈Mαsuch that |ZMα(β)|=∞. Because α >1, there exists N∈Nsuch
thatαn∤Mαβfor anyn∈Zwithn > N. AsMαis atomic, A(Mα) ={αn|n∈Z}
by Theorem 3.1. Consequently, there is a bijection ZMα(β)→ZMα(β/αN) given by
multiplication by α−N. In addition, β/αNis not divisible by any positive power of αin
Mα. Then after replacing βbyβ/αN,we can further assume that αk|Mαβimplies that
k≤0. Since Mα−1=Mαis atomic, it follows from Proposition 3.4that the additive
monoidN0[α−1] is neither antimatter nor ﬁnitely generated. Hence, [ 12, Theorem 4.1]
guarantees that A(N0[α−1]) ={α−k|k∈N0}. As a result, the fact that αk∤Mαβfor
anyk∈Nensures that ZMα(β) =ZN0[α−1](β) and, therefore, that |ZN0[α−1](β)|=∞.
Thus,N0[α−1] is not an FFM. Now it follows from [ 12, Theorem 4.11] that N0[α−1]
does not satisfy the ACCP. However, this is a contradiction to the f act thatN0[α−1] is
a submonoid of the reduced monoid Mα, which satisﬁes the ACCP. Hence, Mαis an
FFM. /square
4.2.A Class of FFMs that are not UFMs. We have exhibited in Examples 3.5
and4.2some atomic monoids Mαthat do not satisfy the ACCP. However, the only
examples we have so far of monoids Mαsatisfying the ACCP (or, equivalently, being
FFMs)arethetrivialcases, namely, thosecorrespondingto α= 1andαtranscendental.
Our purpose in this subsection is to produce monoids Mαthat are FFMs for some
algebraic αdiﬀerent from 1. This will yield monoids Mαthat are FFMs but not
UFMs.
To do so, let α1,α2∈Rbe distinct roots of an irreducible quadratic polynomial in
Q[x], and set M:=Mα1andK:=Q(α1). ThenKis a real quadratic ﬁeld extension
ofQthat contains the monoid M. In addition, let T:Q(α1)→R2be theQ-linear map
induced by the assignments 1 /mapsto→(1,1) andα1/mapsto→(α1,α2), and set M′=T(M). Let
TM:M→M′be the map obtained by restricting the domain and codomain of Tto
MandM′, respectively. We use the notation introduced in this paragraph th roughout
the rest of this section.
Lemma 4.4. The following statements hold.10 S. ZHU
(1)Tis an injective Q-algebra homomorphism.
(2)TMis a monoid isomorphism.
(3)M′=/braceleftbig/summationtext

.
Proof.(1) Since Tis aQ-linear map, the equalities T(x+y) =T(x) +T(y) and
T(qx) =qT(x) hold for all x,y∈Q(α1) andq∈Q. For each i∈ {1,2}, we letσi
denote the Q-algebra homomorphism Q(α1)→Rinduced by the assignment α1/mapsto→αi.
Then for each x∈Q(α1), we can verify that T(x) = (σ1(x),σ2(x)).Therefore, for all
x,y∈Q(α1),
T(xy) = (σ1(xy),σ2(xy)) = (σ1(x)σ1(y),σ2(x)σ2(y)) =T(x)T(y).
HenceTis aQ-algebra homomorphism. Note that T(α−1
1) =T(α1)−1= (α−1
1,α−1
2).
Now ifx∈kerTfor some x∈Q(α1), then ( σ1(x),σ2(x)) = (0,0), and so the fact
thatσ1is the inclusion map ensures that x= 0. Thus, Tis an injective Q-algebra
homomorphism.
(2) Since Tis injective, it is also injective when restricted to M⊆Q(α1). Moreover,
becauseM′is the image of MunderT, the map TM:M→M′is a bijection. In addi-
tion, thelinearityof ToverQimmediately impliesthat TMisamonoidhomomorphism,
making it a monoid isomorphism from MontoM′.
(3) Finally, let xbe an arbitrary element in M. Thenx=/summationtext

In order to establish the main result of this section, we need the follo wing two
lemmas.
Lemma 4.5. LetMbe an additive submonoid of R2
≥0. Ifv,w∈Mwithv= (v1,v2)
satisfyv+M⊆w+M, thenw∈[0,v1]×[0,v2].
Proof.Sincev+M⊆w+M, we see that wdividesvinMand, therefore, we can
writev=w+d, whered= (d1,d2)∈M⊆R2
≥0. Thenw= (v1−d1,v2−d2) belongs
to [0,v1]×[0,v2]. /square
For the rest of this section, we further assume that 0 < α1<1< α2. We observe
that, in light of part (3) of Lemma 4.4, the inclusion M′⊆ {(0,0)}∪R>0×R>0holds.
Lemma 4.6. If(v1,v2)∈M′, then the set M′∩([0,v1]×[0,v2])is ﬁnite.EVALUATION MONOIDS OF LAURENT SEMIRINGS 11
Proof.Setv:= (v1,v2) andSv:=M′∩([0,v1]×[0,v2]). Ifv= (0,0), then Svis a
singleton and thus ﬁnite. Now we assume that v/\e}atio\slash= (0,0). Note that since α−1
1>1
andα2>1,the sequences ( α−n
1)n∈N0and (αn
2)n∈N0both increase to inﬁnity and, as a
result, the nonempty set
N:={n∈Z|αn
1≤v1andαn

is bounded. Let mbe the maximum of N. Take a nonzero s∈Sv. SinceTis injective,
there exists a unique α∈Msuch that s=T(α). Write

i=0qiα−i

i=0piαi

whereq0,...,q mandp0,...,p mare nonnegative integers. As a result, we see that

.
Becauseα2>1, after looking at the second coordinate of s, we infer that pi≤piαi
2≤
v2for every i∈ {0,...,m}. Hence, there are at most ( v2+ 1)m+1many possible
(m+ 1)-tuples ( p0,p1,...,p m) to choose for the respective coeﬃcients of α0
1,...,αm
1
for a representation of αas in (4.1). Symmetrically, since α−1
1>1,there are ﬁnitely
many possible ( m+ 1)-tuples ( q0,q1,...,q m) one can choose to express αas in (4.1).
Consequently, the set T−1
M(Sv) is ﬁnite, which implies that Svis also ﬁnite. /square
We are in a position to prove that Mis an FFM.
Theorem 4.7. Suppose that α1andα2are the roots of an irreducible quadratic poly-
nomial in Q[x]such that 0< α1<1< α2. ThenMα1is an FFM and, therefore,
satisﬁes the ACCP.
Proof.DeﬁneT:Q(α1)→R2andM′as before. Let v= (v1,v2) be a nonzero element
inM′. It follows from Lemma 4.6thatSv:=M′∩([0,v1]×[0,v2]) is a ﬁnite set. On
the other hand, it follows from Lemma 4.5that every divisor of vinM′belongs to Sv.
Therefore, vhas only ﬁnitely many divisors in M′and, as a result, M′is an FFM
by virtue of [ 23, Theorem 2]. Since Mis isomorphic to M′and being an FFM is an
algebraic property, we conclude that Mis an FFM, whence it satisﬁes the ACCP. /square
There are monoids Mαthat are FFMs but not UFMs. The following example illus-
trates this observation.12 S. ZHU
Example 4.8. Consider the polynomial p(x) :=x2−2x+1
2∈Q[x]. Since the roots
ofp(x) areα:= 1−√
2
2andβ:= 1 +√
2
2, it is an irreducible polynomial. In light of
Theorem 4.7, the chain of inequalities 0 < α <1< βguarantees that the additive
monoidMαis an FFM. However, Mαis not a UFM: indeed, since 1 ,α,α2∈A(Mα)
by Theorem 3.1, the two sides of the equality 4 α= 2α2+1 yield distinct factorizations
of the same element of Mα(see also Proposition 5.1in the next section).
5.Factoriality and Elasticity
In this last section, we characterize the monoids Mαthat are half-factorial, and we
brieﬂy discuss the elasticity of Mα. The elasticity is a factorization invariant that
measures how far from being half-factorial a given monoid is.
5.1.Half-Factoriality. Recall that an atomic monoid Mis an HFM if |L(x)|= 1 for
everyx∈M. In the class consisting of evaluation monoids of Laurent semirings, being
an HFM and being a UFM are equivalent conditions. We determine such m onoids in
the following proposition.
Proposition 5.1. Forα∈R>0, the following statements are equivalent.
(a)Mαis an UFM.
(b)Mαis an HFM.
(c)α= 1orαis transcendental.
Proof.(a)⇒(b): This follows by deﬁnition.
(b)⇒(c): Suppose for the sake of contradiction that αis an algebraic number not
equal to 1. Let ( pα(x),qα(x)) be the minimal pair for mα(x) overZ. Because Mαis an
HFM, it is an atomic monoid; thus, A(Mα) ={αn|n∈Z}by Theorem 3.1. Hence,
zp=pα(α) andzq=qα(α) are factorizations for the same element of Mα. AsMαis an
HFM,pα(1) =|zp|=|zq|=qα(1), which implies that 1 is a root of mα(x). However,
this contradicts the irreducibility of mα(x).
(c)⇒(a): Ifα= 1, then Mα=N0; hence, it is a UFM. On the other hand,
suppose that αis transcendental. Then any equality of the form 1 =/summationtext
n∈Zcnαn,
where all but ﬁnitely many cnare zero, implies that c0= 1 and cn= 0 for every
n/\e}atio\slash= 0. Therefore 1 ∈A(Mα), and it follows from Theorem 3.1thatMαis atomic.
Now suppose that p(α) andq(α) are two factorizations of the same element in Mα,
wherep(x),q(x)∈N0[x,x−1]. Takek∈Nsuch that f(x) :=xk(p(x)−q(x))∈Z[x].
Sincef(α) = 0, the fact that αis transcendental ensures that f(x) = 0 and, hence,
p(x) =q(x). Thus, the factorizations p(α) andq(α) are identical, concluding that Mα
is a UFM. /squareEVALUATION MONOIDS OF LAURENT SEMIRINGS 13
We proceed to discuss a dual notion of half-factoriality. A monoid Mis called a
length-factorial monoid (LFM) provided that for all a∈Mandz,z′∈Z(a), the
equality |z|=|z′|implies that z=z′. Observe that every UFM is an LFM. The
notion of length-factoriality was ﬁrst considered in [ 13] under the term “other-half-
factoriality,” and it has been recently investigated in [ 8,16,19]. On the other hand,
not every LFM is a UFM, as illustrated next.
Example 5.2. Letq∈Q>1\Nand consider the additive submonoid MofQ≥0
generated by the set {1,q}. Since 1 = min M•andq /∈N, we conclude that A(M) =
{1,q}. In addition, one can check that if z1:=m1+n1qandz2:=m2+n2qare two
factorizationsofthesameelementof Mhavingthesamelengths, then m1+n1=m2+n2
and, therefore, ( m1,n1) = (m2,n2); that is, z1=z2. Thus,Mis an LFM. However, M
is not a UFM since, for instance, the two sides of the equality n(q)·1 =d(q)·qyield
distinct factorizations of n(q) inM. Additive submonoids of Q≥0that are LFMs have
been determined in [ 22, Proposition 2.2].
Proposition 5.3. Forα∈R>0, Mαis an LFM if and only if it is a UFM.
Proof.Ifαis transcendental, then Mαis a UFM; hence, the statement of the propo-
sition immediately follows. Then we assume that αis algebraic. It suﬃces to ar-
gue the direct implication, for the reverse implication follows by deﬁnit ion. To do
this, suppose, by way of contradiction, that Mαis not a UFM. Then there exists
an element of Mαhaving two distinct factorizations, namely, p(α) andq(α), where
p(x),q(x)∈N0[x,x−1]. After rearranging ( α−1)p(α) = (α−1)q(α), we obtain that
z1:=αp(α) +q(α) andz2:=αq(α) +p(α) are factorizations of the same element
inMα. Observe that z1/\e}atio\slash=z2as, otherwise, the Laurent polynomials p(x) andq(x)
would satisfy xp(x)+q(x) =xq(x)+p(x), which is not possible because p(x)/\e}atio\slash=q(x).
However, the fact that |z1|=p(1) +q(1) =|z2|indicates that z1andz2are distinct
factorizations of the same element having the same length, which co ntradicts the fact
thatMαis an LFM and completes the proof. /square
Now we can summarize the main results we have established in this pape r via the
following diagram of implications, which is a specialization of Diagram ( 1.1) for the
class consisting of all the evaluation monoids of Laurent semirings. A s illustrated in
Examples 3.5and4.8the two (one-way) implications in the diagram are not reversible.
(5.1) [UFM⇔HFM⇔LFM]⇒[FFM⇔BFM⇔ACCP]⇒atomicity14 S. ZHU
5.2.The Elasticity. We conclude this paper by saying a few words about the elas-
ticity of the monoids Mα. LetMbe an atomic monoid. The elasticity of a nonzero
elementx∈M, denoted by ρ(x), is deﬁned as
ρ(x) :=supL(x)
minL(x).
In addition, we set ρ(M) := sup{ρ(x)|x∈M•}and call it the elasticity ofM. Notice
thatρ(M)≥1. Furthermore, observe that ρ(M) = 1 if and only if Mis an HFM. As
a result, the elasticity provides a measure of how far is an atomic mon oid from being
half-factorial.
As we proceed to argue, the elasticity of every monoid Mαis either 1 or inﬁnity.
Proposition 5.4. Ifα∈R>0, thenρ(Mα) = 1if eitherα= 1orαis transcendental,
andρ(Mα) =∞otherwise.
Proof.Ifα= 1 orαis transcendental, it follows from Proposition 5.1thatMαis an
HFM and, therefore, ρ(Mα) = 1.
Now suppose that αis algebraic and α/\e}atio\slash= 1. We construct a sequence ( βn)n∈Nwith
terms in Mαsuch that sup {ρ(βn)|n∈N)}=∞. Let (p(x),q(x)) be the minimal
pair ofα. Thenz1:=p(α) andz2:=q(α) are two distinct factorizations of the same
element, namely, β1∈Mα. Since 1 is not a root of the minimal polynomial of α, we see
thatp(1)/\e}atio\slash=q(1), soz1andz2are factorizations of diﬀerent lengths. Suppose, without
loss of generality, that |z1|<|z2|. For each n∈N, setβn=βn
1.Then we see that, for
everyn∈N, bothzn
1andzn
2are factorizations of βninMαwhose lengths are p(1)n
andq(1)n, respectively. Therefore
ρ(Mα)≥ρ(βn) =supL(βn)
minL(βn)≥q(1)n
p(1)n=/parenleftbigg|z2|
|z1|/parenrightbiggn
for every n∈N. Since|z2|/|z1|>1, it follows that ρ(Mα) =∞, which concludes the
proof. /square
