where for every n,(ξα)α⊂Rare iid random variables independent of (xα,yα)α, and(xα)α,(yα)α⊂Rn
are two (not necessarily independent) sets of independent r andom vectors having diﬀerent covariance
matrices and generating well concentrated bilinear forms. We consid er two main asymptotic regimes

isotropic “in average”, we prove the convergence in probabi lity of the empirical spectral distributions

distribution, correspondingly. In particular, choosing n ormalized Rademacher random variables as
(ξα)α, in the modiﬁed regime one can get a shifted semicircle and se micircle laws. We also apply our
results to the certain classes of matrices having block stru ctures, which were studied in [9, 21].
1 Introduction
In [9, 21], the authors studied the empirical spectral distr ibutions of the following two related models
of sparse block matrices. Given r,d∈N, let(vkl)1≤k<l≤rbe independent copies of a random vector v
uniformly distributed on the unit sphere in Rd, and let (ξkl)1≤k<l≤rbe independent copies of a 0/1random
variableξ=ξrsuch that Eξ=prfor some pr∈(0,1]. Deﬁne ArdandLrdasrd×rdblock matrices of
the form

k,ℓ=1−Ard, (1.1)
where for 1≤k < l≤rblocks
Bkℓ=ξkℓvkℓvkℓT(1.2)
ared×drank-one matrices with probability pr(and 0 otherwise). These models were introduced in
[9] while studying the elastic vibrational modes of amorpho us solids. Roughly speaking they describe a
system of r d-dimensional points connected by springs (see also [15, 27] and references therein for the
application of these models in the study of certain disorder ed systems). Evidently, for d= 1matrices Ard
andLrdreduce to the adjacency matrix and Laplacian of the Erdős–Ré nyi graph.
Recall that given a Hermitian or symmetric n×nmatrixMnwith eigenvalues (λi)i, the empirical
spectral distribution NMnofMnand its Stieltjes transform sMnare deﬁned by the formulas

1In [9, 21], the authors studied the empirical spectral distr ibutionsNArdandNLrdasr→ ∞ in diﬀerent
asymptotic regimes, depending on dandpr. In the case when dandrprare some ﬁxed numbers (sparse
matrices), the ﬁrst several moments of the limiting distrib utions were computed. In the “dense” regime
when
d→ ∞, pr=O(1),andprr/d→c >0,asr→ ∞,
theconvergence in mean ofNLrdandNArdto the Marchenko-Pastur law and to the so called eﬀective
medium spectral distribution, correspondingly, was prove d. (Here we follow terminology from [9], see also
[23].) It was shown that the limits of the corresponding Stie ltjes transforms, fL:= lim r→∞EsLrdand
fA:= limr→∞EsArd, satisfy equations
2zf2
L+(z+2−c)fL+1 = 0 andzf3
A+(1−c)f2
A−zfA−1 = 0. (1.3)
Also the ﬁrst several moments of NArdandNLrdwere calculated in the so called “dilute” regime when d
is ﬁxed and pr=O(r−δ),δ∈(0,1), asr→ ∞, and it was claimed that for big enough rthese moments
coincide with the moments of the semicircle and shifted semi circle distributions and, in particular,
2f2
Lrd+(z−cr)fLrd+1 = 0 andcrf2
Ard+zfArd+1 = 0, (1.4)
wherecr:=rpr/d→ ∞, asr→ ∞.
In our work we suppose that dgrows to inﬁnity with r. We modify the dilute regime as follows:
pr→0andr/d→ ∞ whilecr=rpr/d→c≥0asr,d→ ∞. This guarantees that the corresponding
sequences of empirical spectral distributions NLrdandNArdare tight and also allows to unify two regimes
as follows:
d→ ∞ andrpr/d→c≥0asr→ ∞. (1.5)
We consider models (1.1) corresponding to normalized isotr opic vectors (vkℓ)k<ℓwhich generate well-
concentrated bilinear forms (see Assumption 1), and applyi ng the Stieltjes transform method give a
straightforward proof of the convergence in probability of NLrdandNArdto the Marchenko-Pastur law
and the eﬀective medium spectral distribution. We show that the limits are the same for both regimes
(in contrast to (1.3) and (1.4)), and that to get (1.4) with cr=cin the new dilute regime, (ξkℓ)k<ℓneeds
to take both negative and positive values with non-zero prob ability. In particular, one can get (1.4) if
(ξkℓ)k<ℓare properly normalized Rademacher random variables (see E xample 3 and Remark 1.6).
Note that we can rewrite matrices ArdandLrdin the form
Lrd=/summationdisplay
1≤k<ℓ≤rξkℓYkℓYkℓTandArd=/summationdisplay
1≤k/negationslash=ℓ≤rξkℓXkℓXℓkT, (1.6)
whereξkℓ=ξℓk,(Xkℓ)k/negationslash=ℓand(Ykℓ)k<ℓare sparse block vectors in Rrdgiven by
Ykℓ= ((δjk−δjℓ)vkl)r
j=1andXkℓ= (δjkvkl)r
j=1.
This naturally leads to the study of more general classes of r andom matrices of the form

αξα(yαxT

whereξα∈Randyα,xα∈Rn,α≤m, are some random variables and vectors. We mainly concentra te
on model Ln, which is closely related to the sample covariance matrices , only that here we allow vectors
(yα)αto have diﬀerent covariance matrices Qα:=EyαyT
α,α≤m(note that here Qαare not necessarily
centered). We suppose that these vectors are normalized and isotropic "in average", m−1/summationtext
αQα≈n−1In,
which allows to show that the empirical spectral distributi ons still converge to the Marchenko-Pastur
2law. A similar model was considered in [25] and [16], where th e convergence of spectral distributions
was studied, in particular, for matrices of the form/summationtext
αyαyT
αcorresponding to vectors with essentially
diﬀerent covariance matrices (not isotropic in average). I n these papers the limiting distribution is given
implicitly (in terms of asymptotic closeness to the solutio n of a certain system of equations), and our
result does not follow directly from [25, 16]. Certain close ly related models were also studied in [8],
where the authors proved the convergence to the Marchenko-P astur law of empirical spectral measures
corresponding to the certain block-independent models and tensor models (in [8], see also a review of known
results on convergence to the Marchenko-Pastur law with rel axed independence requirements including
[18, 26, 14, 4, 6, 19, 1, 22, 13, 24]).
In (1.6), we choose (yα)αand(ξα)αfrom the following classes.
Assumption 1. We suppose that for every n∈N,yα=yα,n∈Rn,α≤m,are mutually independent
random vectors such that for all deterministic matrices D=Dnwith/bardblD/bardblop= 1we have
sup
αVar(Dyα,yα) =o(1), n→ ∞. (1.8)
Here and in what follows, given a matrix Dwe use notations /bardblD/bardblopand/bardblD/bardblHSfor its operator and
Hilbert-Schmidt norms.
Assumption 2. For every n∈N, letξα=ξα,n∈R,α≤m,be mutually independent copies of a random
variableξnwith a cumulative distribution function σn. To treat simultaneously both cases, m/n=O(1)
andm/n→ ∞,m
nEξn=O(1), we introduce a signed measure /tildewideσn, which controlsm
nEξn. Let/tildewideσnbe deﬁned
as follows: for every ﬁnite ∆⊂R
/tildewideσn(∆) =m
n/integraldisplay
∆ξdσn(ξ).
We suppose that as n→ ∞,/tildewideσnconverges weakly to a signed measure /tildewideσsuch that |/tildewideσ(R)|<∞, and
sup
n/integraldisplay
|ξpd/tildewideσn(ξ)|= sup
nm
nE|ξn|p+1<∞, p= 1,2,3.
We use notation c1:=/tildewideσ(R)∈R,|c1|<∞.
Remark 1.1. Note that if m/n→c >0, then/tildewideσn=cσn+o(1)asn→ ∞. Also, a bit more delicate but
quite standard nowadays argument based on a truncation proc edure for ξn(see, for example, [19]) allows
to show that the results of Theorem 1.2 below remain valid wit hout any moment conditions on σnin the
casem/n=O(1)and with the only moment conditionm
nEξn=O(1)in the case m/n→ ∞,m/n2→0.
Our main result concerns convergence of the empirical spect ral distributions of (Ln)n, it can be
considered as a generalization of Theorem 3.3 of [19] (for H(0)= 0) on the case of “samples” with entries
having diﬀerent covariance matrices.
Theorem 1.2. Givenm,n∈N, consider n×nmatrices

whereξαandyα∈Rn,α≤m, are mutually independent random variables satisfying Ass umptions 1, 2.
LetQα:=EyαyT

Remark 1.3. A simple renormalization allows to show that if in (1.9) and ( 1.10) we have
sup
α|TrQα−a|=o(1)andQ(n)=a

thenzf=−1+af/integraltext
(1+aξf)−1d/tildewideσ(ξ).Also in the case d/tildewideσ(ξ) =cξdσ(ξ)we restore the Marchenko-Pastur
distribution.
Some additional information about the moments of ξαallows to solve (1.11) exactly, here are several
simple examples:
Examples. In the following three examples we use notations δandδ′for the Dirac delta function and
its generalized derivative, and ρ,/tildewideνn,/tildewideνfor the densities of N,/tildewideσn,/tildewideσ, correspondingly.
1. Let(ξn)nbe not random, and ξα,n=bn→b,mbn/n→c1asn→ ∞. Then
/tildewideνn=m
nξδ(ξ−bn)→/tildewideν=c1δ(ξ−b),
and by (1.11) fsatisﬁesbzf2+f(z+b−c1)+1 = 0 , so that
ρ(λ) =/braceleftbiggδ(λ−c1) ifb= 0,

((c+−λ)(λ−c−))+,ifb/\e}atio\slash= 0,(1.12)
wherex+=xifx≥0and 0 otherwise and c±= (√
b±√c1)2.
2. Let for every n,(ξn)nare 0/1 random variables such that P(ξn= 1)m/n→c1asn→ ∞. Then
again/tildewideν=c1δ(ξ−1), and we get (1.12) with b= 1.
3. Suppose that all moments of /tildewideσare ﬁnite,
cj:=/integraldisplay
ξj−1d/tildewideσ(ξ) = lim
n→∞m
nEξj
n<∞,∀j≥1,
and for some k0≥1we have cj= 0∀j > k0. Note that this is possible only if k0≤2, and moreover, for
k0= 2the condition 0< c2<∞whilec3= 0is not fulﬁlled for pure non-negative (or pure non-positive )
random variables. Indeed, if ξn≥0a.s. then by the Schwartz inequality we would have
0< c2= limm
nEξ2
n≤limm
n(Eξ3
nEξn)1/2=c1c3= 0.
So letξntake both negative and positive values with positive probab ility, and cj= 0∀j≥3. Then
expanding (1+ξf(z))−1into the Taylor’s series we get from (1.11) c2f2+(c1−z)f+1 = 0 , thus in this
case the limiting density is given by the shifted semicircle law,

4Return now to the starting point of this research, namely, mo delsLrdandArd(1.1) introduced and
studied in [9, 21], and consider ﬁrst Laplacian Lrd. It is easy to check that the condition /bardblQα/bardblop=O(n−1)
of Theorem 1.2 is not fulﬁlled (now n=rdwhile/bardblEYkℓYkℓT/bardblop=O(d−1)), hence we cannot apply
Theorem 1.2 directly. Nevertheless, using the sparsity of v ectorsyα=Ykℓand slightly modifying the
proof of Theorem 1.2, we get the following result for Lrd:
Theorem 1.4. LetLrdbe deﬁned in (1.1) - (1.2), where for every r∈N,(ξkℓ)1≤k<l≤rare iid copies of
a0/1random variable ξ=ξrwithP(ξ= 1) =pr, and(vkl)1≤k<l≤rare mutually independent normalized
isotropic random vectors, EvklvklT=d−1Id, satisfying Assumption 1 and having norms uniformly bounde d
inr. Then in regime (1.5), NLrdconverge in probability to a non-random probability measur eNLwith
the density
ρ(λ) =1

((c+−λ)(λ−c−))+, c±= (√
2±√c)2.
As to adjacency matrices Ard, in Section 4 we ﬁrst treat matrices having a more general str ucture and
prove an analog of Theorem 1.2 for matrix Andeﬁned in (1.7) (see Theorem 1.5). Then using essentially
the same scheme we get the following result for Ard:
Theorem 1.5. LetArdbe deﬁned in (1.1) - (1.2), where for every r∈N,(ξkℓ)1≤k<l≤rare iid copies of
a0/1random variable ξ=ξrwithP(ξ= 1) =pr, and(vkl)1≤k<l≤rare mutually independent normalized
isotropic random vectors, EvklvklT=d−1Id, satisfying Assumption 1 and having norms uniformly bounde d
inr. Then in regime (1.5), NArdconverge in probability to a non-random probability measur eNAwhich
Stieltjes transform fAis uniquely determined by the second equation in (1.3) in the class of Stieltjes
transforms of non-negative measures.
Remark 1.6. 1. One can ﬁnd the explicit forms of the solution of the cubic e quation (1.3) and the
density of NAin [23] and [9].

(see also Remark 4.2.)
The structure of the remaining part of the paper is very simpl e: in Sections 2, 3, and 4 we give the
proofs of Theorems 1.2, 1.4, and 1.5, correspondingly. The p roof of Theorem 1.2 (based on [19]) is more
detailed, while in the rest of the proofs we mostly discuss pl aces which should be modiﬁed.

2 Proof of Theorem 1.2
The proof is based on the standard nowadays method of Stieltj es transform which goes back to [18] (see
[2, 3, 5, 20] for the details of the method and main properties of the Stieltjes transform), and which is used
in a huge number of results on convergence of empirical spect ral distributions of random matrices. This
method is based on the fact that there is a one-to-one continu ous correspondence between non-negative
measures and their Stieltjes transforms, so that to ﬁnd a wea k limit in probability of random probability
measures NLnit is enough to show that for every z∈C\Rthe Stieltjes transforms sn:=sLnofNLn
converge in probability to a deterministic limit fsatisfying limη→∞η|f(iη)|= 1. Thenfis the Stieltjes

Our scheme of the proof is as follows: in Lemma 2.2 we show that Varsn(z) =o(1)asn→ ∞, that
reduces the problem to ﬁnding the limit of the expectations Esn:=fn, then in the main body of the proof
(Lemma 2.3) we show that for every convergent subsequence of (fn)n, its limit satisﬁes (1.11), and ﬁnally,
the unique solvability of (1.11) in the class of the Stieltje s transforms of probability measures follows from
Lemma (2.1) below.
Lemma 2.1. (Solvability and uniqueness). Let /tildewideσbe a signed measure deﬁned in Assumption 1. Then there
is a unique solution fof (1.11) in the class of Stieltjes transforms of the non-neg ative measures. Moreover,
limη→∞η|f(iη)|= 1, so that the corresponding to fmeasure Nis a probability measure, N(R) = 1.
Proof. We show ﬁrst that if fis the Stieltjes transform of a non-negative measure Nthen for any ξ∈R
|1+ξf(z)|−1≤max{2,4|ξ|/|ℑz|}. (2.1)
(Note also that for ξ >0we have a simpler bound |1 +ξf(z)|−1≤ |z|/|ℑz|, which follows from the
inequality ℑzℑf(z)≥0.) To this end given ξ∈Rdeﬁne

Ifz∈Eξ, we have |1+ξf(z)|>1/2. Ifz /∈Eξ, by the Schwartz inequality/integraltext
|λ−z|−2dN≥1/(2|ξ|)2,
so that|1+ξf(z)| ≥ |ξ||ℑz|/integraltext
|λ−z|−2dN≥ |ℑz|/(4|ξ|),and (2.1) follows.
By the conditions of the lemma we have
/integraldisplay
d/tildewideσ(ξ) =c1<∞and/integraldisplay
|ξpd/tildewideσ(ξ)|<∞, p= 1,2,3. (2.2)
Note that/integraltext
|d/tildewideσ(ξ)|is not necessarily ﬁnite, that is why it is better to rewrite ( 1.11) in the form
zf(z) =−1+c1f(z)−f(z)2/integraldisplayξd/tildewideσ(ξ)
1+ξf(z),
where now by (2.1) – (2.2),/integraltext
|ξ(1+ξf(z))−1d/tildewideσ(ξ)|is uniformly bounded in
z∈Cη0:={z∈C:η=ℑz≥η0} (2.3)
for some η0>0. In particular this allows to show that limη→∞η|f(iη)|= 1. Next, if there are two
solutions f1,f2of this equation, than
z(f1−f2) = (f1−f2)/parenleftBig
c1−/integraldisplayξ(f1+f2+ξf1f2)d/tildewideσ(ξ)
(1+ξf1)(1+ξf2)/parenrightBig
,
where as it follows from (2.1) – (2.2), if f1/\e}atio\slash=f2then the r.h.s. is uniformly bounded and the l.h.s. tends
to inﬁnity as z→ ∞. Hence f1=f2. The solvability of (1.11) in the class of Stieltjes transfo rms of the
non-negative measures follows from the Banach ﬁxed-point th eorem.
LetG(z) := (Ln−zIn)−1,z∈C\R, be the resolvent of Ln, so that sn=n−1TrG. Lemma 2.2 below
shows that the variance of sntends to zero as n→ ∞, hence, by Chebyshev’s inequality the convergence
of(sn)nin probability follows from the convergence in means.
6Lemma 2.2. (Self-averaging properties.) Under conditions of Theorem 1.2 we have uniformly in z∈Cη0

Girko (see [10] and [20]). For every 1≤α≤m, introduce

αE/vextendsingle/vextendsingleTr(G−Gα)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2,
(see also Lemma 3.2 [17]), where by the resolvent identity

and (2.4) follows. Here we also used that as it follows from As sumptions 1,2, E|ξα|2andE/bardblyα/bardbl4

and by (1.9) we get (2.5).
As it follows from Lemma 2.2 (i), it remains to show that for ev eryz∈C\Rthe expectations of
snconverge to fwhich solves (1.11). Then since fis the Stieltjes transform of a non-negative measure
(which is in fact a probability measure due to the tightness o fENLn), Lemma 2.1 ﬁnishes the proof of
Theorem 1.2.
Lemma 2.3. (Convergence in mean.) Let fn:=Esn=n−1ETrG. Then for every z∈C\Rthere exists
limn→∞fn(z) =:f(z), andfsatisﬁes (1.11).
Proof. Since|fn(z)| ≤ |ℑz|−1, there is a subsequence (fnj)njand an analytic function f(z),z∈C\R,
such that (fnj)njconverges to funiformly on every compact set in C\R. Due to the uniqueness property
of analytic functions it suﬃces to consider domain Cη0(2.3) for some ﬁxed η0>0which will be chosen
later, and to show that every convergent subsequence conver ges inCη0to a solution fof (1.11).

(more precisely,/integraltext

so it has only four non-zero blocks (equal d−1Id). To check the conditions of Theorem 1.2 note ﬁrst that
now

so that (1.8) for Ykℓfollows from (1.8) for vkℓ. Also it is easy to check that TrQkℓ= 2and

and/bardblBrd/bardblHS=o((rd)−1/2),r→ ∞, thus (1.10) is fulﬁlled. The only condition of Theorem 1.2 w hich is
not fulﬁlled is the ﬁrst part of (1.9), namely, we have /bardblQkℓ/bardblop=O(d−1)(instead of /bardblQkℓ/bardblop=O((rd)−1)).
On the other hand, matrix Qkℓis very sparse and has only four non-zero blocks.
Hence we need to go through the proof of Theorem 1.2 and check t he places, where condition (1.9)
was used. There are three such places: Lemma 2.2 (ii), (2.10) , and (2.15) – (2.16). As to Lemma 2.2 (ii),
we reprove it in Lemma 3.1 below. Now we recall the main steps o f the proof of Lemma 2.3 and check
(2.10) and (2.15) – (2.16).
Similar to (2.8), one can get

|Akℓ|−1,|EAkℓ|−1≤1/(1−2C0/η0).
We also have E(GkℓYkℓ,Ykℓ) =ETrQkℓGkℓ. Similar to (2.10), here we can replace GkℓwithG. Indeed,
since by the deﬁnition of Qkℓ,
(QkℓX,Y) =1

then to show that Rn,α,R′

114 Adjacency matrices. Proof of Theorem 1.5
The scheme of the proof is essentially the same as in the case o f Laplacian Lrd. The main diﬀerence is
that here for every vector Xkℓin the deﬁnition of Ard(see (1.6)) there are two terms containing this
vector,XkℓXℓkTandXℓkXkℓT, so that in order to separate this vector from the rest we need to apply the
rank one perturbation formula twice. Also it is convenient t o consider ﬁrst a more general model without
block structure. We have

Then as n→ ∞ the empirical spectral distributions NAnconverge in probability to a non-random
probability measure NAwhich Stieltjes transform fis uniquely determined by the equation
zf3+(1−2c1)f2−zf−1 = 0 (4.1)
in the class of Stieltjes transforms of non-negative measur es.
Remark 4.2. A more general case corresponding to ξαsatisfying Assumption 2 contains more pure
technical details and we do not treat it here, but we strongly believe that following essentially the same
scheme one can prove that in this case fsolves the equation
zf=−1−2f2/integraldisplayξd/tildewideσ(ξ)
1−ξ2f2.
Proof. Following the scheme of the proof of Theorem 1.2 note ﬁrst tha t the proof of the analog of
Lemma 2.1 is trivial in this case and the proof of the analog of Lemma 2.2 is essentially the same.
Thus we only need to prove the convergence in mean (cf Lemma 2. 3). To this end introduce

which leads to (4.1) and ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 4.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.5. Now we have
Ard=/summationdisplay
1≤k/negationslash=ℓ≤rξkℓXkℓXℓkT, Xkℓ= (δjkvkℓ)n
j=1, (4.8)
so that in terms of Theorem 1.4
/summationdisplay
α=/summationdisplay
1≤k<ℓ≤r, m=r(r−1)/2, n=rd, c1=c/2,xα=Xkℓ,yα=Xℓk, k < ℓ,
and the analogs of QxαandQxyαare given by
Qkk:=EXkℓXkℓT=d−1(δikδjkId)r
ij=1,TrQkk= 1,and
Qkℓ:=EXkℓXℓkT=d−1(δikδjℓId)r
ij=1.
We suppose that (vkℓ)k<ℓhave uniformly bounded norms, so let C0>0be such that /bardblvkl/bardbl2
2≤C0for
everyk < ℓ.
Checking the conditions of Theorem 4.1, note ﬁrst that (iii) follows from the deﬁnition of Xkℓand
conditions for vkℓ. As to (v-vi), these conditions are not fulﬁlled with/summationtext
α=/summationtext
k<ℓ, but since in (4.8) we
have/summationtext
k/negationslash=ℓ, by the deﬁnitions of Qkℓwe get the following analogs of (v-vi):

14Thus again the only condition which is not fulﬁlled is the ﬁrs t part of (iv), because now /bardblQkk/bardblop,/bardblQkℓ/bardblop=
O(d−1)(instead of O((rd)−1)). On the other hand, matrices (Qkk)kare “orthogonal” up to normalisation:
QkkQpℓ=1
dδkpQkℓ,and also QkkXpℓ=1
dδkpXkℓ, (4.9)
thus in the corresponding places of the proof we have single s ums instead of double sums. This allows to
repeat the proof of Theorem 4.1 with slight modiﬁcations and to get ﬁrst
zfr+1 =1

k/negationslash=ℓEξkℓ(GXkℓ,Xℓk) =c−c

Akℓ, (4.10)
where
Akℓ= (1+(GkℓXkℓ,Xℓk))2−(GkℓXkℓ,Xkℓ)(GkℓXℓk,Xℓk).
Since for any matrix B,|(Bvkℓ,vkℓ)| ≤C0/bardblB/bardblop, we have
VarAkℓ≤C(η0)max
k,ℓ{Var(GkℓXkℓ,Xℓk),Var(GkℓXkℓ,Xkℓ)}, (4.11)
where we use notation C(η0)for every positive function uniformly bounded in η0→ ∞,
C(η0) =O(1), η0→ ∞.
It follows from Assumption 1 and Lemma 4.3 below that
Var(GkℓXkℓ,Xℓk) =EVarkℓ(GkℓXkℓ,Xℓk)+VarTrQkℓGkℓ=o(1),and
Var(GkℓXkℓ,Xkℓ) =EVarkℓ(GkℓXkℓ,Xkℓ)+VarTrQkkGkℓ=o(1), (4.12)
(cf (4.11)), hence, VarAkℓ=o(1),r→ ∞. Also similar to (4.4) one can show that the terms containing
E(GkℓXkℓ,Xℓk) = TrQkℓGkℓdo not contribute to the limit. It follows from above that

and choosing η0big enough we get similar to (2.17) ∆′
r=o(1), which leads to (2.11). To ﬁnish the proof
of Theorem 1.4, it remains to prove the following statement, which is an analog of Lemma 3.1 (see also
Lemma 2.2).
Lemma 4.3. LetVr:= max 1≤k,ℓ≤rVarTrQkℓG. ThenVr=o(1)asr→ ∞.
Proof. Note that the simple trick based on the resolvent identity, w hich we have used in the last line of
the proof of Lemma 3.1 to get reed of the double sum over i,j, does not work here. So we will go another
way.
For every q≤r, it follows from (4.14) that
zVarTrQqqG=zETrQqqG(TrQqqG)◦

k/negationslash=qEξkq(GXkq,Xqk)(TrQqqGkq)◦+Rr, (4.15)

2/η2
0=O(d−1),
hence,Rr=O(d−1). Also, we have
VarTrQqqG=VarTrQqqGkq+O(d−1).
Applying (4.2), one can continue (4.15) and get similar to (4 .10)
zVarTrQqqG=−c

k/negationslash=qE(1+(GkqXkq,Xqk))(TrQqqGkq)◦

Since by the Schwartz inequality
|E(GkqXkq,Xqk)(TrQqqGkq)◦|=|ETrQkqGkq(TrQqqGkq)◦|
≤(VarTrQkqGkq)1/2(VarTrQqqGkq)1/2≤Vr+O(d−1),
we have |T(1)
r| ≤C(η0)Vr+O(d−1). It follows from (4.11) – (4.12) that VarAkq≤Vr+o(1). This and
the Schwartz inequality allows to get
|T(2)
r| ≤C(η0)V1/2
r(max
k,qVarAkq)1/2≤C(η0)Vr+o(1).
16Summarising we get from for every q≤r
η0VarTrQqqG≤C(η0)Vr+o(1).
Similar, one can show that η0VarTrQqkG≤C(η0)Vr+o(1)for every k,q. Hence, taking maximum over
k,q, we get η0Vr≤C(η0)Vr+o(1), whereC(η0)remains bounded as η0→ ∞. Thus choosing η0big
enough we get Vr=o(1)asr→ ∞. This ﬁnishes the proof of the lemma and the proof of Theorem 1 .5.
