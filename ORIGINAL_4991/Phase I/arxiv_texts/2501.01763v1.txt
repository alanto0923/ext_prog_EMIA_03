Abstract:  Following an analysis of existing AI -related exchange -traded funds (ETFs), 
we reveal the selection criteria for determining which stocks qualify as AI -related are 
often opaque and rely on vague phrases and subjective judgments. This paper proposes 
a new, objective, data -driven approach using natural language processing (NLP) 
techniques to classify AI stocks by analyzing annual 10 -K filings from 3,395 
NASDAQ -listed firms between 2011 and 2023. This analysis quantifies each 
company's engagement with AI throu gh binary indicators and weighted AI scores 
based on the frequency and context of AI -related terms. Using these metrics, we 
construct four AI stock indices —the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), the Size -
Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time -Discounted AI I ndices (TAII05 and 
TAII5X) —offering different perspectives on AI investment. We validate our 
methodology through an event study on the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, 
demonstrating that companies with higher AI engagement saw significantly greater 
positive abn ormal returns, with analyses supporting the predictive power of our AI 
measures. Our indices perform on par with or surpass 14 existing AI -themed ETFs and 
the Nasdaq Composite Index in risk -return profiles, market responsiveness, and overall 
performance, a chieving higher average daily returns and risk -adjusted metrics without 
increased volatility. These results suggest our NLP -based approach offers a reliable, 
market -responsive, and cost -effective alternative to existing AI -related ETF products. 
Our innovat ive methodology can also guide investors, asset managers, and 
policymakers in using corporate data to construct other thematic portfolios, 
contributing to a more transparent, data -driven, and competitive approach.

The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 catalyzed a global surge in corporate investment 
and public interest in artificial intelligence (AI). Companies across various sectors significantly 
increased their inve stments in AI technologies; however, some have exaggerated their involvement, 
leading to regulatory scrutiny. For instance, the SEC charged two investment advisers for making 
misleading AI -related disclosures, a practice termed "AI washing" (SEC, 2024) . Concurrently, there 
has been a proliferation of AI -related Exchange -Traded Funds (ETFs), raising questions about the 
expertise of asset managers in the complex domain of AI technologies. We find that the composition of 
these AI ETFs often reflects subject ive decision -making rather than a reliance on robust, objective, 
quantifiable metrics. This raises a critical inquiry: How equipped are traditional asset managers —
individuals who may not necessarily have a background in technology —to assess the AI -relatedn ess of 
a company accurately?  
Defining what constitutes an "AI stock" or an "AI -themed" investment is a complex challenge that lies 
at the heart of this research. We aim to develop a scholarly framework to understand and categorize 
such investments by first  clarifying AI's role within the investment arena: Is AI utilized as a tool for 
investment management, or do the investments represent stakes in AI technology companies? In this 
study, we concentrate on stocks and indices that provide investors with opport unities to engage with 
and profit from AI technology itself. This focus raises a pivotal question: How can a stock or index be 
accurately identified as AI -centric? For example, consider Nvidia —a company crucial to the AI 
industry due to its production of c hips essential for AI computing. Yet, Nvidia's influence extends 
beyond AI, impacting industries such as gaming and cryptocurrency mining. This underscores a 
fundamental insight: stocks or indices are rarely exclusively tied to a single technology like AI.  Instead, 
they are often strategically positioned to maximize AI exposure while acknowledging their multi -
sectoral influence.  
A preliminary examination of thematic indices focused on AI reveals that the selection criteria for 
investments are often opaque, relying on vague phrases such as " companies that potentially stand to 
benefit from increased adoption and utilization of […] artificial intelligence " (Global X, 2023a)  or 
“companies that could benefit from the long -term growth and innovation in […] artif icial intelligence ” 
(iShares, 2023) . These subjective statements hinder the development of a clear, general concept of "AI 
stocks.” To address the challenge of objectively identifying AI -centric investments, our study develops 
a data -driven methodology f or classifying AI stocks based on publicly available corporate disclosures. 
We leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze annual 10 -K filings from 3,395 
NASDAQ -listed firms spanning 201 0 to 202 2, aiming to quantify each company's enga gement with AI 
technologies. Our approach involves creating both a binary indicator of AI mention and a weighted AI 
score that reflects the frequency of AI -related terms in these disclosures. Specifically, our methodology begins with the extraction and pre processing of textual data from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission's (SEC) Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) database. We 
identify specific AI -related keywords through bibliometric analysis, focusing on terms such as 
"artificia l intelligence"  and "AI." By calculating term frequencies and applying the term frequency -
inverse document frequency (TF -IDF) weighting scheme, we obtain a measure of each firm's emphasis 
on AI in their filings (see Section 3 .2). This allows us to objectiv ely assess the degree to which 
companies are involved in AI based on their own disclosures. Using these AI engagement metrics, we 
construct four AI stock indices: the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), the Size -Weighted AI Index 
(SAII), and two Time -Discount ed AI Indices (TAII05 and TAII5X). These indices differ in how they 
weigh companies based on their AI engagement and account for historical disclosures, providing 
alternative perspectives on AI investment opportunities. We then compare the performance of t hese 
indices against 14 existing AI -themed ETFs, analyzing their risk -return profiles, market reactions to the 
ChatGPT launch, and overall investment performance.  
To validate our AI classification methodology, we conduct an event study centered on the mark et 
reaction to the launch of ChatGPT. We hypothesize that companies with a higher degree of AI 
engagement, as indicated by our metrics, would exhibit more significant positive abnormal returns 
following this pivotal AI -related event. Our findings support t his hypothesis, demonstrating that our 
objective measures effectively capture market perceptions of AI involvement. Regression analyses 
further support the validity of our metrics, revealing a significant predictive power of our AI measures 
and the cumulat ive average abnormal returns (CAARs) observed.  Comparative analysis shows that our 
objectively constructed AI indices perform on par with, or even surpass, existing AI -themed ETFs in 
terms of market response and investment performance. This suggests that our methodology offers a 
reliable and market -responsive approach to creating AI stock indices, providing investors with a viable 
alternative or complement to existing AI -themed investment products. Such an approach could enhance 
competition among index providers and potentially reduce ETF expense ratios (An et al., 2023) , 
benefiting investors seeking exposure to the AI sector.  
In summary, our study presents a coherent and logical framework for objectively identifying and 
evaluating AI -focused investments. By utilizing NLP -based analysis of corporate dis closures, we create 
data-driven AI engagement metrics that inform the construction of competitive AI stock indices. Our 
methodology addresses the opacity and subjectivity found in existing AI -themed ETFs and offers 
empirical support through market reaction  analyses. This contributes to the literature on thematic 
investing and offers practical implications for investors and asset managers in the rapidly evolving AI 
investment landscape.  
Our study makes meaningful contributions to the existing literature on f inancial markets and corporate 
disclosures, with a particular focus on AI technology. We address a notable gap in current research, 
contributing to the development of measures on the basis of company filings, such as 10 -Ks  (Andreou et al. 2020) . Buildin g upon the foundational work of Beaver (1968)  and Griffin (2003)  on how corporate 
information influences stock valuations, our results enhance the understanding of market reactions to 
technology disclosures in corporate filings (Aharon et al., 2022; Ca hill et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2019) . 
Specifically, by analyzing the market reaction to the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT as a validation 
measure for AI -focused stocks, we contribute to research on technology launches and their impact on 
financial markets , particularly in the context of AI advancements (Ante and Demir, 2024; Saggu and 
Ante, 2023) . Furthermore, our comparative analysis of our data -driven AI stock indices and existing 
AI-themed ETFs uncovers the relative (in -)effectiveness of the latter. The findings suggest that asset 
managers and index providers should incorporate quantitative, objective metrics when selecting assets 
for inclusion, contributing to the literature on ETF selection criteria. Notably, our results indicate that 
index providers  may be overcharging for their services —potentially accounting for over one -third of 
expense ratios  (An et al., 2023) —when a straightforward NLP -based approach can yield comparable or 
even superior results.  
By providing both methodology and empirical evi dence on the identification of AI stocks, the 
development of AI stock indices, and the performance dynamics of AI -themed ETFs, our study fills a 
critical gap in the literature. Although research on these specific topics is limited, the broader themes 
are increasingly relevant in today's technological landscape (Claus and Krippner, 2018; Somefun et al., 
2023) . Our work extends the understanding of thematic ETFs, particularly those centered around 
emerging technologies like AI, by assessing their market per formance against suitable benchmarks. Our 
contribution enhances the field of ETF and index performance analysis (Häusler and Xia, 2022; 
Schröder, 2007)  and offers practical insights for investors interested in technology -driven thematic 
investing (Wu and  Chen, 2022) . Additionally, our focus on transparency and the challenges associated 
with thematic ETFs adds to the discourse on the risks and rewards of thematic investing (Blitz, 2021a; 
Raghunandan and Rajgopal, 2022) , especially in sectors characteri zed by rapid technological evolution 
and market volatility. By exploring these issues, this study bridges the gap between theoretical 
constructs of thematic investing and the practical realities faced by investors in the dynamic AI sector. 
This alignment o f theoretical insights with practical applications underscores the significance of our 
research for both academia and the investment industry.  
The primary objective of this study is to develop an objective, data -driven methodology for classifying 
AI stocks  based on publicly available corporate disclosures. By leveraging natural language processing 
(NLP) techniques on annual 10 -K filings, we aim to quantify each company's engagement with AI 
technologies. Specifically, we seek to answer the following research  questions: (I) How can an NLP 
analysis of 10 -K filings be utilized to measure a company's objective engagement with AI?; (II) Do 
companies with higher AI engagement, as measured by our methodology, exhibit significantly different 
market reactions to major  AI-related events, such as the launch of ChatGPT?; (III) How do AI stock 
indices constructed using our objective measures compare in performance to existing AI -themed ETFs and market benchmarks in terms of risk -return profiles and market responsiveness? B y addressing these 
questions, we aim to contribute to the  above -mentioned  literature on thematic investing and offer 
practical implications for investors, asset managers, and policymakers in the rapidly evolving AI 
investment landscape.  
This study begins i n Section 2.1 by reviewing the literature on the information content and impact of 
public corporate disclosures, particularly 10 -K filings, on market dynamics and continues in Section 
2.2 by examining thematic investing and the role of ETFs in capturing in vestment themes like AI. In 
Section 3.1, we detail the data collection process for stock and exchange -traded fund returns used in 
our analysis; Section 3.2 describes our methodology for measuring AI engagement in stocks through 
natural language processing of corporate filings; and Section 3.3 outlines the construction of four AI 
indices based on these AI measures. Section 4.1 validates our AI stock classification by analyzing 
market reactions to the launch of ChatGPT; Section 4.2 assesses the predictive pow er of our AI indices 
on abnormal returns; and Section 4.3 examines abnormal returns specifically in AI -classified stocks. In 
Section 4.4, we compare the AI engagement in our indices with existing AI -themed ETFs, and Section 
4.5 provides a comprehensive per formance assessment of our AI indices and these ETFs. Section 5.1 
discusses implications for theory, highlighting contributions to finance and innovation literature; 
Section 5.2 explores practical implications for investors, fund managers, and policymakers ; and Section 
5.3 addresses limitations and suggests avenues for future research. Finally, Section 6 concludes the 
study by summarizing our findings and emphasizing their significance for thematic investing in AI.  
 
2. Literature Review  
2.1. Information Content and Public Disclosures  
The study of financial markets has extensively  explored how disclosures by public companies influence 
market dynamics, including stock returns and trading volumes , a crucial component in understanding 
how markets respond to n ew information and how this affects investment behavior (Admati and 
Pfleiderer, 1988) . Advancements in  information technology ha ve greatly  reduced costs and  enhanced 
the speed of data generation, aggregation, and analysis  (Johnson, 2001) . This shift ha s emphasized the 
importance of data processing and interpretation over mere data possession (Lee and Cho, 2005) . 
A notable technological advancement in this arena is the implementation of the EDGAR  system , 
introduced  in the 1990s, which has improved the timeliness and availability  of corporate filings  such as 
10-K reports . Consequently , expertise in data management, information processing, and financial 
literacy has become indispensable for effective stock valuation a nd trading strategies  (Lusardi and 
Mitchelli, 2007; van Rooij et al., 2011) . This is further underscored by the increasing complexity and length of these  filings, which often challenge investors to interpret financial information effectively 
(Dyer et al. , 2017) . 
Beaver’s (1968)  seminar work illustrated  the significant  impact of earnings announcements on stock 
prices , revealing  a market reaction  to corporate financial disclosures . Later studies showed that delays 
or lack of transparency in filings can amplify market reactions, suggesting the importance of timely and 
clear disclosures in stabilizing or informing stock market  behaviors  (Griffin, 2003; Morse, 1981) . This 
body of research reinforces the idea that earnings announcements and other key discl osures remain 
pivotal events, affecting stock price fluctuations and influencing trading activity (Beaver et al., 2020; 
Bonsall et al., 2020; Vamossy, 2021) . 
The information value  of 10 -K filings, particularly concerning  market reactions to firms ‘ financial  
disclosures , has been a significant focus  of academic  focus. Studies confirmed  that investors deem the 
information  content  disclosed valuable (Aharony and Swary, 1980; Ball and Kothari, 1991; Bonsall et 
al., 2020; Noh et al., 2021; Stice, 1991) , supporting the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) (Fama, 
1970). These disclosures  introduce new, pertinent information to investors, influencing the supply and 
demand dynamics that determine an asset ‘s equilibrium price, as ref lected in observable stock price 
fluctuations post -disclosure.  
The relationship between 10 -K filings and stock market responses  is multifaceted. While key financial 
metrics like earnings per share or dividends may be anticipated or are even  public knowledg e before 
the official filing with the SEC, actual  filing days are associated with abnormal stock price changes , as 
10-K filings reveal additional  insights into a company ’s future performance (You and Zhang, 2009).  
Research  has analyzed  various aspects of the information content in financial reports . For instance, this 
includes  the impact of report readability and complexity on confidence in reported information  
(Rennekamp, 2012)  or how these factors influence trading behavior  (Miller,  2010)  and bond ratings  
(Bonsall and Miller, 2017) . This suggests that clarity in disclosures signals firm transparency and 
quality (Spence, 1973) . 
Additionally, company disclosures play a crucial role in bridging the information asymmetry between 
a company and its stakeholders  (Campbell et al., 2014) . The quality of financial reporting, therefore, 
becomes a pivotal factor influencing investor decisions. High -quality reporting, characterized by clarity 
and comprehensive detail, can attract investors  by signaling  robust company health. Conversely, reports 
that hint at potential risks or lack transparency may deter investment. In essence, the nature of financial 
reporting in 10 -K filings not only reflects a company's current state but also shapes inves tor perceptions 
and market responses.   
 2.2. The ChatGPT Effect  
Since the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, which quickly became the fastest -growing 
consumer application on record (Hu, 2023) , the debate about the capabilities of artificial intelligence 
(AI) technologies has gained significant traction acros s various sectors, particularly in financial 
markets. The breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a global conversation 
regarding AI‘s purported potential (Bhaimiya, 2023; Murphy Kelly, 2023) , resulting in a spillover effect 
that has e levated both the perceived potential and profitability of AI -centered investments.  
The growing global focus on AI and its capabilities has significantly influenced investor behavior, as 
evidenced by notable stock performance in the sector. For instance, Nv idia's stock value more than 
quadrupled (Bowman, 2024),  and AI -specialized firm c3.ai saw its stock rise by 28% following the 
incorporation of ChatGPT into its AI toolset (Fox, 2023) . Even Buzzfeed, a digital media company not 
primarily associated with  AI, experienced a 120% surge in its share price following the announcement 
of adopting OpenAI's technology for content creation (Diaz and Smith, 2023) . These examples reflect 
a broader market trend where companies benefit from their association with AI,  regardless of their direct 
involvement with ChatGPT or LLMs. Further illustrating this trend, companies like BigBear.ai and 
SoundHound AI saw significant stock gains following the launch of ChatGPT (Singh and Biwas, 2023), 
highlighting increased investor confidence in AI -focused businesses. However, this surge in AI -related 
investments has also led to regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, research on crypto assets has shown that 
AI-centric assets have experienced significant abnormal positive price movements due to the heightened 
perception and valuation of AI's potential post -ChatGPT (Ante and Demir, 2024; Saggu and Ante, 
2023) . This spillover effect underscores the profound impact of AI advancements on stock market 
dynamics and investor sentiment.  
Investor  enthusiasm for AI predates the era of ChatGPT. Research has shown that exchange -traded 
funds (ETFs) with “AI” in their names were valued approximately 0.4% higher than comparable ETFs 
without the term AI, highlighting an AI name premium (Wu and Chen, 2022 ). Recent advancements in 
LLMs have extended this early recognition of AI’s (perceived) economic significance. It is important 
to acknowledge that LLMs and the broader field of generative AI —which, e.g., includes the creation of 
pictures, music , or video s—represent just one application area of AI that has captured significant public 
interest. Nevertheless, the success of generative AI does not detract from AI’s potential in other 
domains. In fact, the achievements in generative AI likely contribute to a s pillover effect, enhancing the 
perceived overall potential of AI across different sectors.  
Given the rising influence of AI in financial markets, corporate disclosures of AI will likely  become 
critical in shaping investor perceptions and decision -making. T he substantial stock performance boosts 
observed following AI -related announcements underscore the market’s demand for transparent and 
reliable AI reporting —also to prevent "AI washing" (SEC, 2024) . As companies increasingly integrate AI, the frequency a nd clarity of their AI disclosures could serve as valuable indicators of technological 
engagement, offering investors a clearer view of a company’s long -term growth potential and 
innovative capabilities. The market's response to AI mentions —as evidenced by  significant stock price 
reactions —would suggest that consistent, well -defined AI disclosures enhance investor confidence and 
allow for more precise valuation assessments. Thus, as AI continues to redefine industries, accurate 
reporting of AI involvement i n corporate filings will likely become a cornerstone of informed 
investment strategies, providing investors with essential insights into a company’s technological 
trajectory and competitive positioning in an AI -driven world.  
 
2.3. Technology and AI in Public  Disclosures  
Corporate filings, particularly 10 -K reports, have long been a key source for extracting firm -level 
insights, with recent analyses focusing on technology -related disclosures due to their potential impact 
on stock performance . For example,  Andreou et al. (2020)  employed textual analysis to formulate a 
measure of market orientation and uncover a positive correlation with firm performance. Research has 
identified that technology -specific announcements, includi ng those on blockchain and the metaverse, 
often prompt positive market reactions, underscoring investor receptiveness to technological 
advancements as indicators of future growth potential (Aharon et al., 2022; Cahill et al., 2020; 
Cheng et al., 2019) . 
In parallel,  the recent literature has focused  on the analysis  of sustainability -related topics, notably 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) (Cannon et al., 2020)  and environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) issues (Jiang et al., 2023) . For instance , Baier et al. (2020)  highlighted that an average of 4% of 
all words in 10 -K reports pertained to ESG, signifying the growing importance of these issues in 
corporate disclosure and communication, a sentiment echoed by Heichl and Hirsch (2023) . The tone  
used in communicating ESG matters within 10 -K filings has been linked to stock market performance 
around the filing dates (Ignatov, 2023) . This underscores the significance not just of the content but also 
of the manner in which it is conveyed, reinforc ing the idea that the qualitative aspects of corporate 
communications are pivotal in shaping market reactions.  
Amid these disclosure trends, AI -related information has emerged as a new focal point, yet research in 
this area remains limited . Mishra et al. ( 2022)  found that AI usage in firms, as identified through textual 
analysis, correlates with higher profitability and efficiency. On the other hand, Wang and Yen (2023)  
discovered that firms disclosing AI involvement tend to have higher stock prices , and AI-related risk 
disclosures are viewed positively by investors. While both studies have clear relevance to this study, 
they pursue significantly different objectives.  
 2.4. Thematic Investing and ETFs  
As investors increasingly seek exposure to companies actively engaged in transformative technologies 
like AI or in adhering to ESG standards, thematic investing has gained popularity as a strategy to target 
long-term trends that influence the global econom y. This investment approach centers on capitalizing 
on emerging areas such as technological innovation, demographic shifts, and environmental changes 
(Claus and Krippner, 2018) , thus aligning with the growing emphasis on thematic corporate disclosures 
explored above. The growing popularity of thematic investment strategies reflects investors' growing 
interest in high -growth areas and innovative industries, as thematic investing aligns portfolios with these 
dynamic shifts (Somefun et al., 2023) . sectors positioned to benefit from these overarching trends, 
thematic investing represents a forward -looking approach that increasingly relies on corporate 
disclosures of sector -specific engagement, like technology adoption or sustainability practices 
(Dheeriya an d Malladi, 2019; Methling and von Nitzsch, 2020, 2019) . 
Thematic ETFs, including those focused on technology , AI,  or ESG, serve as  prime examples for 
thematic investing by giving investors direct access to specific market segments without the need to 
handpick individual stocks. T echnology ETFs , for example,  include investments  ranging from 
established technology  companies to emerging fields like AI, robotics, and biotech  (Wu and Chen, 
2022) . These ETFs align with thematic investment goals by focusing on sectors expected to drive 
economic growth and innovation, providing investors with a diversified entry point into the companies 
leading these trends. Thematic ETFs promise to simplify access to specific m arket segments by offering 
targeted exposure without the need for investors to handpick individual stocks. This feature is especially 
appealing to investors who want exposure to trends but lack the resources or expertise to identify or 
analyze individual c ompanies engaged in these areas.  
However, thematic  investing presents  unique  challenges  related to  transparency in asset selection . A 
primary concern is the opacity in asset selection criteria for these funds, which raises questions about 
how closely their  portfolios truly align with advertised themes. This lack of clarity complicates the 
evaluation process for investors, who may find it difficult to determine whether a thematic ETF 
genuinely reflects the underlying trends it claims to target  (Raghunandan a nd Rajgopal, 2022) . For 
instance, while technology -themed ETFs promote exposure to innovation, the predictive nature of 
thematic investing inherently carries speculative risks due to its reliance on forward -looking 
assumptions about technological trends and adoption rates (Blitz, 2021a) . Ben-David et al. (2023)  
highlight that specialized ETFs tend to underperform over their first five years, with about a 30% risk -
adjusted loss. This underperformance is linked to the overvaluation of underlying stocks at the time of 
the launch, suggesting that providers cater to investors ’ extrapolative beliefs by issuing ETFs that focus 
on attention -grabbing themes rather than delivering sustainable value.  These factors collectively underscore the importance of investo r diligence and awareness of the speculative and volatile nature 
inherent in thematic investing within the dynamic technology sector.  
For the topic of AI, Bonaparte (2023)  introduced an exemplary valuation model for AI stocks and ETFs, 
utilizing the corr elation between AI -related Google Trends sentiment and stock performance. This 
innovative approach underscores the potential for alternative, sentiment -driven measures in evaluating 
AI-focused ETFs, yet differs significantly from the methodology in this st udy. Here, we address the 
opacity and misalignment challenges in thematic ETFs by introducing a data -driven framework based 
on corporate disclosures designed to identify and quantify AI engagement among firms objectively. Our 
approach aims to provide inves tors with a more transparent and reliable method for assessing AI -themed 
assets, ensuring that these ETFs align closely with genuine technological involvement rather than 
speculative trends. By focusing on objective metrics derived from firm -level disclosu res, this study 
aims to make thematic investing in technology sectors, especially AI, more efficient and relevant to 
long-term investor goals.  
 
3. Data Background and Methodology  
3.1. Stock and Exchange -Traded Fund Returns  
To construct our empirical dataset, we begin by extracting a complete list of all 4,316 assets listed on 
the Nasdaq stock exchange from January 1, 201 0, to September 1, 202 2, using the Nasdaq stock 
screener tool. 1 2 The Nasdaq was specifically selected due to its historical preference for a more 
accommodating listing of technology firms, a factor that contributes to its reputation as a primarily 
technology -oriented exchange. This is evident in its substantial weighti ng towards technology 
companies, including those specializing in artificial intelligence  (Nasdaq, 2024) . For each stock, we 
obtained the historical daily closing price and Central Index Key (CIK) from the S&P Capital IQ 
 
1 Different online data sources, including the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and Thomson 
Reuters Eikon, report varying numbers of assets listed on the Nasdaq. To address these inconsistencies and ensure 
accuracy , we consulted Nasdaq directly. The Nasdaq recommended using their Stock Screener tool as the 
definitive source of data. This tool, which enables the filtering and analysis of stocks, is accessible online at 
https://www.nasdaq.com/market -activity/stocks/screener . 
2 The complete list of assets comprises those from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which includes large -cap 
companies meeting the most stringent financial and liquidity standar ds; the Nasdaq Global Market, featuring mid -
cap companies that satisfy moderately rigorous requirements; and the Nasdaq Capital Market, which lists small -
cap companies meeting baseline entry criteria. This stratification ensures a diverse representation of  companies 
across different market capitalizations and financial thresholds.  database.3 Following a thorough d ata-cleaning process removing non -stock assets, we obtained a 
sample of 3,470 stocks. After mapping each asset to its CIK, we derive a final sample of 3,395 stocks.  
In addition to sourcing Nasdaq stocks, we utilized the VettaFi ETF database to identify AI -related ETFs 
and conducted a targeted online search using key phrases such as "AI ETF," "AI stocks," and "invest in 
artificial intelligence" to capture a broader range of relevant AI -focused funds. Our resulting sample 
comprises 14 of the largest AI ETFs a vailable. The list is not intended to be exhaustive but rather 
representative of the largest AI ETFs available. Table  1 documents each ETF's ticker symbol, full name, 
expense ratio, and asset count.4 The last column includes an excerpt of the high -level l ogic from each 
fund's documentation, summarizing the types of assets included based on a review of each ETF's 
website.  
A preliminary analysis reveals several issues. First, many AI -focused ETFs include related themes such 
as robotics, big data, and deep le arning rather than solely focusing on AI. Secondly, the criteria for asset 
inclusion are often vague and nonspecific. For instance, many ETF providers use broad language in 
their descriptions of asset selection criteria, such as including companies "that p otentially stand to 
benefit from increased adoption and utilization of artificial intelligence." In many cases, the ETFs are 
using an arbitrary selection of stocks that they consider AI -related rather than relying on any real 
objective metric. This finding  reinforces the critical role of our research in establishing an objective 
metric to address the arbitrariness observed in current ETF asset selection.  
For each ETF, we collect the historical daily closing prices and CIK, along with those of the Nasdaq 
Com posite Index (IXIC) and the S&P 500 Index (SPX), for benchmarking purposes , from S&P Capital 
IQ. The daily prices for 3,395 stocks, 14 AI -related ETFs, SPX, and IXIC are subsequently converted 
into daily logged returns.  
 
 
3 The Central Index Key (CIK) is a unique identifier assigned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) to entities that file disclosures and reports with the SEC, such as public companies and investment funds. 
The CIK distinguishes between entit ies and facilitates the retrieval of public filings from the SEC's EDGAR 
(Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) database. It ensures that each entity's filings can be accurately 
tracked and accessed.  
4 Figure A.1 illustrates a scatter plot co mparing the expense ratios and mean daily returns of the AI -themed ETFs 
listed in Table  1. Each data point represents an individual ETF, plotted according to its expense ratio and 
corresponding mean daily return over the specified period. This visual repre sentation aids in analyzing the cost -
efficiency of these ETFs, providing empirical insight into the relationship between the costs incurred by investors 
and the returns generated. Notably, the AI -themed ETFs exhibit expense ratios significantly higher than  0.25%, 
positioning them at the higher end of the ETF pricing spectrum. Our analysis does not reveal a positive correlation 
between expense ratios and returns during the period under consideration, suggesting that higher fees do not 
necessarily translate i nto better performance in the AI -themed ETF market.  Table  1. Overview of artificial intelligence -related exchange -traded funds

3.2. Measuring AI in Stocks  
To measure the extent to which each of the 3,395 stocks is related to AI, we firstly begin by utilizing 
the advanced search function of the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) 
database to collect the annual 10 -K filings for each stock over the sample period. The 10 -K filings are 
comprehensive reports that publi cly traded companies file annually to disclose their financial 
performance. Mandated by the SEC, these filings provide detailed information on a company's financial 
health, including earnings, expenses, assets, liabilities, and other relevant metrics. They  serve as 
essential tools for investors and analysts, offering deep insights into a company's operations, market 
position, and strategic direction  (Mishra et al., 2022) . Notably, the 10 -K filings often contain references 
to the company's engagement with emerging technologies like AI, shedding light on their strategic 
priorities and innovation initiatives.  
Secondly, the text of each filing was cleaned and tokenized. This process, which is a fundamental 
preprocessing step in natural language processing (NLP ), involves breaking down the text into smaller 
units called tokens, such as words or phrases. This helps in analyzing the text more effectively. For 
instance, the phrase 'we utilize artificial intelligence' would be tokenized into individual words: ['we',  
'utilize', 'artificial', 'intelligence']. This step ensures that our analysis is based on a clear and manageable 
set of data.  
Thirdly, to systematically quantify AI -related activity for each stock, specifically in each company's 10 -
K filings, we conducted  a bibliometric analysis using the Web of Science (WoS) database to identify 
pertinent AI -related terms. Specifically, we used the search string TS="artificial intelligence*"  to 
extract the 500 most recent WoS articles containing this term in their titles or abstracts. Using 
VOSviewer software (van Eck and Waltman, 2010) , we derived the most common keywords, which 
included general terms such as "classification" (N = 20)  and "prediction" (N = 10)  but also more related 
keywords such as "machine learning" (N  = 53) , "deep learning" (N = 27) , "neural network*" (N = 21)  
or "blockchain" (N = 6) . However, to maintain focus on AI -specific disclosures, we restricted our 
analysis to the following core keywords: (1) "artificial intelligence*,"  (2) "ai," and (3) "a.i." . These 
keywords formed the foundation of our analysis, enabling us to construct an objective measure of AI 
involvement across firms based on their 10 -K public disclosures.  
Fourthly, we calculated the frequency of each AI -related keyword within the SEC filings 𝐶𝑖 to 
quantitatively measure the degree of AI engagement for each firm (Equat ion 1):  𝐶𝑖=∑ 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑘𝑖)N
𝑖=1  , (1) 
where 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑘𝑖) represents the frequency of the 𝑘-th keyword in the 𝑖-th filing, and 𝑁 is the number of 
keywords. By quantifying the frequency of AI -related terms, we capture the level of emphasis each 
company places on AI in their public disclosures. This approach provides an objective way to measure 
AI engagement, allowing us to systematically compare firms. In addition to the frequency measure, we 
generated a binary AI dummy variable that indicates whether AI -related terms are present in a given 
year's filing. This binary classification helps to easily identify which firms are explicitly mentioning AI, 
providing a clearer and more detailed picture of how widespread AI adoption is across the sample.  
Figure 1 sh ows a gradual increase in AI mentions in 10 -K filings by NASDAQ -listed firms from 2010 
to 2015, with filings ranging from 7 to 11 per year. From 2016 onwards, the mentions began to rise 
from 37 in 2016 to 86 in 2017 and continued upwards with notable incre ases in 2018 (134 filings), 2019 
(187 filings), and 2020 (239 filings). The most substantial growth occurred in 2021 and 2022, reaching 
442 and 527 filings, respectively. This trend highlights the growing significance of AI in corporate 
strategy and risk d isclosures, indicating broader adoption and integration of AI technologies by 
NASDAQ -listed firms in recent years.  
 
Figure 1. Number of 10 -K filings of NASDAQ firms mentioning AI per year  
 
Note: Figure 1 shows the number of NASDAQ -listed companies with annual 10 -K filings that mention artificial 
intelligence (AI) from 2010 to 2022, based on a dataset of 3,395 assets related to stocks, excluding non -stock 
assets.  11 7 7 9 10 83786134187239442527

Fifth, to further refine our metrics, we adjusted for document length to prev ent longer 10 -K filings from 
biasing the results. Specifically, we identified the most common word (𝑤𝑖) within each filing ( 𝑀𝑖): 
𝑀𝑖=max (𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞 (𝑤𝑖)). (2) 
For a more nuanced measure, we calculated the Term Frequency -Inverse Document Frequency (TF -
IDF). TF -IDF is a commonly used metric in the analysis of large texts that gauge the importance of a 
word to a document in a collection or corpus (Beel et al., 2016 ). The TF -IDF value increases 
proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of 
the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in 
general (Sparck Jone s, 1972) . The TF component measures how frequently a term appears in a 
document. In contrast, the IDF component adjusts for the term's frequency across all documents, thus 
helping to highlight particularly informative terms.  
The term frequency (𝑇𝐹𝑡,𝑑) for a term 𝑡 in a document 𝑑 can be defined as:  
𝑇𝐹𝑡,𝑑=𝑓𝑡,𝑑
∑ 𝑓𝑡′,𝑑 𝑡′∈𝑑. (3) 
The inverse document frequency 𝐼𝐷𝐹 𝑡,Δ for a term 𝑡 in a corpus Δ is computed as:  
𝐼𝐷𝐹 𝑡,Δ =log (∣Δ∣
∣{d∈Δ:∈𝑑}∣). (4) 
where ∣Δ∣ is the total number of documents in the corpus (i.e., the number of 10-K filings in a period 
under consideration – in the case of annual filings =  1), and ∣{d∈Δ:∈𝑑}∣ is the number of documents 
where the term 𝑡 appears.  This adjustment helps to reduce the weight of terms that are common across 
many documents and increase the weight of more unique terms.  The TFIDF  score, 𝑇𝐹-𝐼𝐷𝐹 𝑡,𝑑, for term 
𝑡 within document 𝑑 is thereby calculated as : 
𝑇𝐹-𝐼𝐷𝐹 𝑡,𝑑 =𝑇𝐹𝑡,𝑑×𝐼𝐷𝐹 𝑡,Δ, (5) 
Finally,  we normalize the TF -IDR score by dividing it by the total number of words in a document ( 𝐿𝑑), 
yielding a weighted AI score per stock per period : 
𝑇𝐹-𝐼𝐷𝐹 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ,𝑡,𝑑 =𝑇𝐹-𝐼𝐷𝐹 𝑡,𝑑
𝐿𝑑. (6) 
This normalized TF -IDF score allows us to obje ctively compare the prominence of AI -related terms 
across different firms, regardless of document length. In summary, we derived both a binary AI dummy variable per stock and a weighted AI score per stock, providing a comprehensive view of AI 
engagement. T he binary variable indicates whether a company mentions AI, while the weighted score 
reflects the extent and significance of those mentions. This dual approach enables a deeper 
understanding of the degree to which firms are engaged with AI technology, allo wing for more informed 
comparisons and analyses across the sample.  
 
3.3. Construction of AI Indices  
We construct four distinct AI stock indices, including the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), Size -
Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time -Discounted AI Indices (TAII05 and TAII5X), which reflect 
the intensity and persistence of AI -related disclosures in corporate annual filings, utilizing the metrics 
developed in section 3.3. These indices are developed to provide investors with a more objective and 
data-driven approach to evaluating corporate AI engagement and its impact on market performance, 
ensuring an unbiased and reliable evaluation.5 
The Equally Weighted Artificial Intelligence Stock Index (AII)  serves as a baseline measure, 
incorporating all compa nies that mention AI in their latest (i.e., last year's) annual filings, regardless of 
the extent of their communication.6 This approach assumes equal potential impact from any AI 
disclosure, providing a broad view of the market's engagement with AI witho ut giving undue emphasis 
to any individual firm's disclosure intensity.  The index provides a simple aggregation of the overall 
market's AI engagement.  
The weight assigned to each company 𝑖 in year 𝑡, denoted  as 𝑤𝑖,𝑡 is defined as 1
𝑁𝑡 if the company 
mentions AI in their latest annual filing, where 𝑁𝑡 is the total number of companies . The AII is thereby 
formulated as : 
𝐴𝐼𝐼 𝑡=∑1
𝑁𝑡×𝑁𝑡
𝑖=1𝑉𝑖,𝑡 , (7) 
 
5 The indices presented in this work are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a data -driven approach in 
representing AI engagement compared to existing AI -related ETFs. Our goal is not to optimize  these indices but 
to validate their ability to objectively capture AI involvement. If the indices prove effective, optimizing them 
could serve as a promising foundation for future research, paving the way for more robust and transparent AI -
themed investme nt products.  
6 In the context of our Equally Weighted Artificial Intelligence Index (AII), 'equally weighted' refers to assigning 
equal importance to each company that mentions AI in its disclosures, irrespective of the company's market 
capitalization. This means that every qualifying company contributes equally to the index's performance, 
emphasizing the presence of AI -related activities over the size of the company.  where 𝑉𝑖,𝑡 is the market capitalization of company 𝑖 in year 𝑡.  
 
The Size-Weighted Artificial Intelligence Stock Index (SAII)  differentiates companies based on the 
extent of their AI communication. The underlying rationale is that companies providing more detailed 
and extensive AI disclosures are more likely to invest more resources into AI, demonstrating a deeper 
engagement and a stronger commitment to AI initiatives. This deeper involvement justifies assigning 
these companies a higher weight in the index, reflecting a more meaningful role in AI.  
The weight assigned to each  company 𝑖 in year 𝑡, is defined as 𝑆𝑖,𝑡
∑ 𝑆𝑖,𝑡𝑁𝑡
𝑗=1, where 𝑆𝑖,𝑡 denotes the AI score 
of company 𝑖 in year 𝑡. The SAII is thereby formulated as:  
𝑆𝐴𝐼𝐼 𝑡=∑ (𝑆𝑖,𝑡
∑ 𝑆𝑖,𝑡𝑁𝑡
𝑗=1)×𝑁𝑡
𝑖=1𝑉𝑖,𝑡 . (8) 
 
The Time -Discounted Artificial Intelligence Stock Index (TAII)  introduces a temporal dimension, 
capturing both current and historical AI communications to provide a more comprehensive 
understanding of corporate AI engagement over time. By incorporating the historical context, the TAII 
aims to assess both the immediate impact of AI disclosures and how sustained or past AI engagement 
influences market perception and performance. We construct two variants of TAII: one with a discount 
factor ( 𝛼) of 0.5, reflecting a moderate decay in the re levance of past communications (TAII05), and 
another with 𝛼 set to 5, reflecting  an increasing impact of historical AI communication (TAII5X). These 
variants allow us to examine how different levels of emphasis on past AI activities can potentially 
influe nce market analysis and the overall index performance.  
The TAII for a given 𝛼 is therefore calculated as:  
𝑇𝐴𝐼𝐼 𝑡=∑ (𝐷𝑖,𝑡
∑ 𝐷𝑖,𝑡𝑁𝑡
𝑗=1)×𝑁𝑡
𝑖=1𝑉𝑖,𝑡 , (9) 
where 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 represents the discounted sum of past AI engagements for company 𝑖, defined as  𝐷𝑖,𝑡=
Θ𝑖,𝑡+𝛼×Θ𝑖,𝑡−1+𝛼2×Θ𝑖,𝑡−2+⋯+𝛼𝑛×Θ𝑖,𝑡−𝑛 and Θ𝑖,𝑡 is a dummy variable indicating if a 
company 𝑖 had an AI score in year 𝑡. The discount factor 𝛼 determin es how much weight is given to 
historical AI communications. Higher values of 𝛼 emphasize the importance of past disclosures, while 
a lower discount factor (𝛼) indicates that older AI communications are less relevant.  
All indices are updated daily to ref lect market dynamics, ensuring that the indices remain responsive to 
ongoing changes in AI engagement and stock performance. The indices are also rebalanced annually to maintain consistency and alignment with the latest available data. The value of each in dex on day 𝑡, 
denoted as 𝐼𝑡, is recalculated based on the previous day's index value 𝐼𝑡−1 and the daily returns 𝑅𝑖,𝑡of 
the constituent stocks:  
𝐼𝑡=𝐼𝑡−1×(1+∑ 𝑤𝑖,𝑡𝑁𝑡
𝑖=1×𝑅𝑖,𝑡). (10) 
Our methodology provides a clear, multifaceted, data-driven approach to defining and constructing AI 
indices, in contrast to the arbitrary approaches often employed by ETFs to create AI -themed funds. The 
AII offers a broad market perspective, focusing on the presence of AI disclosures. The SAII provides  a 
deeper analysis by weighing companies based on the extent of their AI engagement, thereby 
highlighting the intensity of corporate commitment to AI initiatives. The TAII, with its temporal 
emphasis, captures the evolving narrative of AI involvement, enab ling a more dynamic assessment of 
how past and present AI communications influence investor perception. Together, these indices offer a 
comprehensive toolset for analyzing corporate AI communication, providing investors with an objective 
framework for unde rstanding AI engagement in the market.  
Figure 2 reveals that all AI indices (AII, SAII, TAII05, and TAII5X) consistently outperformed the 
NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC) from 2011 to 2023, highlighting the value of AI -focused investment 
strategies. Among the se indices, TAII5X demonstrated the highest cumulative return, highlighting the 
benefits of heavily weighting historical AI disclosures when assessing long -term corporate AI 
engagement. While TAII05 and SAII also showed strong performance, they were slight ly below 
TAII5X. The AII, while still surpassing the IXIC, showed comparatively more moderate growth, 
suggesting that assigning equal importance to all AI mentions captures broad engagement but may 
overlook the impact of deeper, sustained AI involvement. T his comparison highlights  the potential for 
better market performance with sustained or historical AI involvement, encouraging readers to consider 
this approach in their investment strategies.

Note: Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative returns of four AI stock indices —Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), Size- 
Weighted AI Index ( SAII), Time -Discounted AI Index with a discount factor of 0.5 (TAII05), and Time -
Discounted AI Index with a discount factor  of 5 (TAII5X) —in comparison to the benchmark NASDAQ 
Composite Index (IXIC) from January 3, 2011, to September 1, 2023.  
 
4. Empirical Model and Results  
4.1. Market Reaction as a Validation of AI Stock Classification  
Mentioning AI in a company's 10 -K filing does not necessarily indicate active AI utilization or qualify 
the company as an AI -focused stock. To assess the accuracy of our AI  stock  classification measures in 
identifying a company's engagement with AI, we initiate the empirical investigation by expl icitly testing 
their response to the launch of ChatGPT . Previous research in crypto  asset markets (Ante and Demir, 
2024; Saggu and Ante, 2023)  demonstrates  that the launch  of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, 
generated significant interest in AI, resulting in greater cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs) 
for AI -focused crypto assets compared to non -AI crypto assets. We hypothesize that a similar effect 
occurred in stock m arkets, leading to positive abnormal returns for AI -focused stocks. While asset 
managers who select AI -themed ETF compositions may not necessarily possess deep technological 
expertise and may use arbitrary inclusion criteria, individual investors with spec ialized knowledge of 
specific companies are more likely to accurately assess a company's AI involvement, which should be 
reflected in their response to the ChatGPT event.  -50%0%50%100%150%200%250%300%350%

IXICSAII To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyze the returns of 2,541 stocks —classified as eit her AI or non -AI—
to test (H 0) if AI stocks exhibit similar CAARs to non -AI stocks after the ChatGPT launch, then our 
NLP -based AI indices do not provide additional value. Conversely, (H 1) significantly different CAARs 
between AI and non -AI stocks indicates  varying levels of AI engagement, thereby reinforcing the 
effectiveness of our data -driven AI indices. For this event study, we employ a market model to estimate 
expected returns, accounting for each stock’s individual risk characteristics:  
𝑅𝑖,𝑡= 𝛼𝑖+𝛽𝑖𝑅𝑚,𝑡+𝜀𝑖,𝑡,  (11) 
Where 𝑅𝑖,𝑡 is the return of stock  or AI index  𝑖 on day 𝑡, 𝑅𝑚,𝑡 represents the return of the reference 
market —the S&P 500 Index (SPX) —on day 𝑡, 𝛼𝑖 is the stock -specific intercept, 𝛽𝑖 measures the 
sensitivity of the stock or AI index return to market movements, and 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 is the error term. We utilize an 
estimation window of one year, equivalent to the 251 trading days, before the ChatGPT launch to 
estimate model parameters and calcul ate expected returns, consistent with event studies  (Campbell et 
al., 2010) . The event window spans three months, equivalent to 61 trading days, following the ChatGPT 
launch on November 20, 2022, consistent with the ChatGPT effect identified in previous studies (Ante 
and Demir, 2024; Saggu and Ante, 2023) . This period allows us to capture both immediate and lagged 
market reactions to the event. To assess the statistical significance of the results, we employ both 
parametric t -tests and nonparametric Wil coxon signed -rank tests (Wilcoxon, 1945) . 
Figure 3 presents the CAARs for all 2,541 Nasdaq stocks over the event window, divided into two 
panels. Panel (a) consists of 582 stocks classified as 'AI stocks' in 2023 based on the TAII05 index, 
while panel (b ) comprises the remaining 1,959 stocks not classified as 'AI stocks.' The CAARs are 
positive and statistically significant for both groups one month following the ChatGPT launch: 17.25% 
for AI stocks (t = 8.24; z = 9.79) and 11.59% for non -AI stocks (t = 1 0.55; z = 10.83). The 5.68% 
difference is statistically significant at the 5% level based on a two -sample t -test, indicating that AI 
stocks had a stronger positive reaction to the ChatGPT launch compared to non -AI stocks. By 
demonstrating a statistically s ignificant difference in the market reactions between AI and non -AI 
stocks, the results bolster the validity of our AI classification methodology. The stronger positive 
abnormal returns for AI stocks suggest that investors recognize and respond to the AI e ngagement of 
companies as captured by our NLP -based measures. This outcome aligns with our hypothesis that the 
launch of ChatGPT would have a more pronounced effect on stocks genuinely involved in AI activities, 
thus providing empirical support for the eff ectiveness of our data -driven AI indices.  
 Figure 3. CAARs for AI and non -AI Nasdaq stocks following ChatGPT launch  
Note: Figure 3 displays the cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs) over a 61 -trading -day (three -month) 
event window following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. Panel (a) illustrates the CAARs 
for 582 stocks classified as AI -related based on the TAII05 index, while Panel (b) depicts the CAARs for the 
remaining 1,959 non -AI stocks. The estimation window  comprises 251 trading days (one year) prior to the event. 
The market model employs the S&P 500 Index (SPX) as the reference market. The gray bands represent the 95% 
confidence intervals, and the orange dotted line indicates the linear trend.  
 
4.2. The Predicti ve Power of AI Indices on Abnormal Returns  
Building upon the statistically significant differences observed between AI and non -AI stocks in Figure 
3, we extend our analysis to examine how effectively our AI indices explain the CAARs following the 
launch of  ChatGPT. Table  3 presents the regression results predicting CAARs for all 2,541 NASDAQ -
listed stocks in our sample. The primary objective is to evaluate whether the AI indices described in 
Section 3.3 serve as significant predictors of the abnormal returns observed afte r this event.

Where 𝐶𝐴𝐴 𝑅𝑖 represents the cumulative average abnormal return for stock 𝑖, 𝐴𝐼_𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 _𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡𝑖,𝑡 
denotes the weight of different AI indices —such as AII, TAII05, and TAII5X —for the years 2022 or 
2023, and 𝜀𝑖 is the error term. Models with odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) employ ordinary least 
squares (OLS) estimation, while even -numbered models (2 , 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) use robust MM y = 0.0026x -118.58

Weighted Artificial Intelligence Stock Index (AII) for 2022. Models 3 and 4 use the AII for 2023. 
Models 5 and 6 employ  the Time -Discounted Artificial Intelligence Stock Index with a discount factor 
of 0.5 (TAII05) for 2022. Models 7 and 8 use the TAII05 for 2023. Models 9 and 10 utilize the Time -
Discounted Artificial Intelligence Stock Index with a discount factor of 5 (T AII5X) for 2022. Models 
9 and 10 utilize the Time -Discounted Artificial Intelligence Stock Index with a discount factor of 5 
(TAII5X) for 2022.  
The estimates in Table  2 reveal that the coefficients for the AI index weights are positive and statistically 
significant across all models. This finding reinforces the reliability of our AI indices in predicting the 
abnormal returns observed after the ChatGPT launch. Specifically, the coefficients are largest for the 
AII metric, followed by the TAII05 metrics, and smallest for the TAII5X metrics. This gradient suggests 
that indices capturing more recent AI engagement (AII and TAII05) have a stronger association with 
abnormal returns compared to those placing greater emphasis on historical AI disclosures (TAII5X) in 
10-K filings. Additionally, the coefficients for the 2022 index weights are consistently higher than those 
for the 2023 weights across corresponding models. This pattern indicates that investors placed greater 
emphasis on prior AI -related disclosures when reacting to the ChatGPT launch, highlighting the 
importance of recent AI communications in shaping market responses. Overall, the results demonstrate 
that our AI indices effectively capture the differential impacts of each company’s AI engagement —as 
reveal ed through 10 -K disclosure —on stock performance. Stocks with higher AI index weights —
indicative of greater AI involvement —exhibited stronger abnormal returns in response to the ChatGPT 
event. Our estimates reinforce the validity of our NLP -based AI stock c lassification methodology and 
helps explain market behavior in the context of significant AI developments.7 
 
7 In line with MacKinlay (1997) , low R -squared values are not necessa rily a limitation in event studies as  the 
analysis focuses on  the significance of the abnormal return rather than the overall explanatory power . The low R -
squared values indicate that numerous factors beyond our AI indices influence stock returns, reflecting the 
complexity of market dynamics. However, the statistical significance of the coefficients suggests that our AI 
indices do capture meaningful variations in cumulative average abnormal returns associated with AI engagement. 
Despite the modest e xplanatory power, the significant coefficients provide evidence that our AI indices are 
relevant predictors of stock performance in response to the ChatGPT launch, thereby validating the utility of our 
NLP -based classification methodology.  Table  2. Regression predicting CAARs for all Nasdaq stocks after ChatGPT launch

Note: Table  2 reports estimates from regressions predicting cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs) for all 2,541 NASDAQ -listed stocks following the ChatGPT launch 
on November 30, 2022, as specified in Equation (12). Models 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 present ordinary le ast squares (OLS) estimates, while Models 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 provide 
robust MM estimates to account for outliers and heteroskedasticity. The independent variables are the weights of stocks in va rious AI indices for 2022 and 2023, including the 
Equally Weighted Artificial Intelligence Index (AII), and the Time -Discounted Artificial Intelligence Indices with discount factors of 0.5 (TAII05) and 5 (TAII5X), as detailed 
in Section 3.3. The CAARs are calculated over a 61 -trading -day event window following th e ChatGPT launch. The estimation window spans 251 trading days prior to the 
event. The market model uses the S&P 500 Index (SPX) as the benchmark. Statistical significance is denoted by *, **, and *** for p -values less than 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01, 
respective ly. Standard errors are reported in parentheses.  4.3. Analysis of Abnormal Returns in AI -classified Stocks  
Building upon the analysis of CAARs across all NASDAQ -listed stocks (Section 4.2), we refine our 
focus to examine the subset of 582 stocks c lassified as AI -related based on our NLP -based 
methodology. Specifically, we aim to assess how effectively the Size -Weighted Artificial Intelligence 
Index (SAII) metrics for 2022 and 2023 explain the abnormal returns of these AI stocks following the 
launch  of ChatGPT. Table  3 presents the regression results employing both OLS and robust MM -
estimator techniques to evaluate this relationship. In these regressions, the independent variables are 
the index weights derived from the SAII for the years 2022 and 202 3. These weights quantify the degree 
of AI -related disclosures by companies within the AI stock classification, effectively serving as proxies 
for the intensity of AI engagement as communicated through their 10 -K filings.  
The regression results indicate st atistically significant positive coefficients for both the 2022 and 2023 
SAII metrics, which reveal that a higher degree of AI -related disclosure is associated with greater 
CAARs among AI stocks following the ChatGPT launch. This finding supports the valid ity of our NLP -
based classification method, demonstrating that the extent of AI engagement, as captured by our SAII 
metrics, has a meaningful and positive relationship with abnormal stock returns in the context of a 
significant AI -related market event. How ever, the absence of a comparative baseline or alternative AI 
classification methods limits our ability to fully assess the relative effectiveness and robustness of our 
NLP -based approach. Future research could enhance this analysis by incorporating additi onal variables 
or employing alternative AI engagement measures to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

4.4. Comparative Evaluation of AI Engagement in Indices and ETFs  
To evaluate the effectiveness of our AI stock classification methodology at the index level, we compare 
the performance of our four AI indices with that of existing AI -themed ETFs and the Nasdaq Composite 
Index (IXIC) following the launch of ChatGPT. We co nduct an event study using daily returns for our 
indices, the 12 AI -focused ETFs identified in Table  1, and the IXIC. The rationale is that if our NLP -
based AI indices effectively capture AI -related market dynamics, they should exhibit significant 
positive  abnormal returns in response to the ChatGPT launch, similar to existing AI ETFs designed to 
provide exposure to AI -related investments.  
As reported in Table  4, all four of our AI indices experienced statistically significant positive cumulative 
abnormal r eturns (CARs) over the three -month event window, with an average CAR of 17.48%.8 
Specifically, the CARs for our indices ranged from 16.19% to 20.97%, with corresponding t -statistics 
all significant at the 5% level. This indicates that our indices effectiv ely captured the positive market 
reaction associated with the ChatGPT launch. In comparison, only half of the existing AI ETFs (6 out 
of 12) exhibited significant positive abnormal returns over the same period, with an average CAR of 
17.58% among these six  ETFs. When considering all 12 AI ETFs, the average CAR was 13.00%; 
excluding the outlier ROBT —which had a negative CAR of -15.37% —the average CAR increased to 
15.58%. Notably, three of the existing AI ETFs (IRBO, ARKQ, and BOTZ) reported the largest posit ive 
market reactions, with CARs of 22.80% and 21.40%.  
Our four AI indices ranked fourth to seventh in terms of CAR magnitude among all indices and ETFs 
analyzed. This competitive positioning suggests that our objective, NLP -based AI stock classification 
method yields indices that are comparable to existing AI -themed ETFs in capturing market responses 
to significant AI -related events. The fact that our indices performed on par with or better than several 
 
8 Abnormal Retur n (AR) measures the difference between a stock's actual return and its expected return during 
the event window, indicating the market reaction to AI -related events. Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) 
aggregates ARs over multiple days to assess the overall im pact, while Cumulative Average Abnormal Return 
(CAAR) averages CARs across all firms in the sample, offering a general view of how AI stocks responded to 
the event. These metrics collectively help quantify investor reactions to the launch of ChatGPT.  existing ETFs provides empirical support for the effi cacy of our methodology. These findings 
emphasize the potential of our objective, data -driven approach in constructing thematic investment 
indices. By effectively capturing the market's positive response to the ChatGPT launch, our AI indices 
demonstrate th eir ability to reflect investors' sentiment toward AI developments. This further validates 
our classification methodology and suggests that such an approach can offer a cost -effective and 
transparent alternative for thematic investing in the AI sector.

 4.5. Comprehensive Performance Assessment of AI Indices and ETFs  
We extend our investigation to evaluate the overall performance of these indices relative to existing AI -
focused ETFs and the broader market. This comprehensive assessment aims to examine both  the short -
term responsiveness and the long -term risk and return characteristics of our indices, providing a more 
holistic view of their effectiveness as investment vehicles in the AI sector. To achieve this, we employ 
a range of traditional financial perf ormance metrics consistent with established practices in financial 
research (Häusler and Xia, 2022; Schröder, 2007; Zatlavi et al., 2014) , allowing for a detailed evaluation 
over the period from June 27, 2019, to September 1, 2023. This time frame repres ents the longest 
common period with available market data for all indices and ETFs under consideration.  
Central to our analysis is the average daily return percentage, (𝑅𝑒𝑡) which reflects the average daily 
percentage change in the value of an ETF or index. This metric provides a foundational comparison of 
the returns generated by different investment instruments. To assess risk, we examine the standard 
deviation (𝑆𝐷) of retu rns, which measures the volatility or variability of returns over the specified 
period. A higher 𝑆𝐷 indicates greater fluctuation in returns, suggesting higher investment risk. 
Additionally, we analyze skewness (𝑆𝑘𝑒𝑤 ) and kurtosis (𝐾𝑢𝑟𝑡 ) to gain insi ghts into the distribution 
of returns. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the return distribution. At the same time, kurtosis 
indicates the propensity for extreme values, both of which are crucial for understanding tail risks and 
the likelihood of signific ant deviations from the mean return, offering insights into the asymmetry and 
extremity of returns.  
In order to contextualize the performance of our AI indices and ETFs relative to the broader market, we 
compute alpha and beta coefficients using the Nasdaq  Composite Index (IXIC) as the benchmark market 
portfolio. Alpha (𝛼) represents the intercept in a regression of the index, or ETF returns, against market 
returns, indicating the ability of the investment to generate excess returns independent of market 
movements. A positive alpha suggests outperformance relative to the market. Beta (𝛽) measures the 
sensitivity of the investment's returns to market movements, quantifying systematic risk. A beta greater 
than one indicates higher volatility compared to the mark et, while a beta less than one suggests lower 
volatility.  We further evaluate the risk -adjusted performance using the Sharpe Ratio (𝑆𝑅), calculated 
as: 
𝑆𝑅=𝑟̅−𝑟𝑖
𝑆𝐷, (13) 
where 𝑟𝑖 is the average return, and is the risk -free rate, operationalized using the 3 -month U.S. Treasury 
bill yield. The Sharpe Ratio assesses the return earned per unit of total risk, facilitating comparisons 
across investments with different risk profiles (Shar pe, 1966) . Complementing the Sharpe Ratio, we 
utilize the Sortino Ratio (𝑆𝑜𝑅 ), which focuses on downside risk by using the standard deviation of negative returns (𝑆𝐷𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛 ) in the denominator , emphasizing the importance of penalizing only 
unfavorable volatility (Sortino and Price, 1994) . This metric is particularly relevant for investors who 
are more concerned with negative deviations from expected returns.  
𝑆𝑜𝑅 =𝑟̅−𝑟𝑖
𝑆𝐷𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛, (14) 
To understand the potential for significant losses, we calculate the Maximum Drawdown (𝑀𝑀𝐷 ), 
defined as:  
𝑀𝑀𝐷 =𝑃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 −𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔 ℎ
𝑃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘×100. (15) 
where 𝑃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is the highest value of the investment before a significant decline, and 𝑃𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔 ℎ is the lowest 
value following the peak. The 𝑀𝑀𝐷  provides insight into the worst -case loss scenario over the 
investment period, which is crucial for risk management an d assessing an investor's exposure to 
potential downturns (Häusler and Xia, 2022) . 
Finally, we employ the Omega Ratio, ω(𝑟𝑖), to assess performance relative to a minimum acceptable 
return, the risk -free rate (𝑟𝑖), operationalized using 3 -month US Treasur y Bills:  
𝜔(𝑟𝑖)=∫(1−𝐹(𝑟))𝑑𝑟∞
𝑟𝑓
∫ 𝐹(𝑟)𝑑𝑟𝑟𝑓
−∞, (16) 
where 𝐹(𝑟) is the cumulative distribution function of returns.  The Omega Ratio provides a 
comprehensive measure of the likelihood of achieving returns above a certain threshold, incorporating 
all moments of the return distribution and offering a more nuanced performance evaluation (Keating 
and Shadwick, 2002) . 
By ap plying spectrum of traditional and sophisticated financial metrics to our AI indices and comparing 
them with existing AI -focused ETFs and the IXIC, we aim to provide a detailed evaluation of their 
performance characteristics. This comprehensive assessment facilitates informed decision -making by 
investors and highlights the potential advantages of our objective, NLP -based approach in constructing 
thematic investment indices. It serves to reveal  how our indices perform in various market conditions 
and whether  they offer competitive returns relative to existing investment options in the rapidly 
evolving AI sector  by comparing performance, risk, and return profiles.  
Table  5 presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of the AI -focused indices  and ETFs . The 
first four entries in Panel (a) —AII, SAII, TAII05, and TAII5X —are the indices we constructed based 
on NLP analysis of SEC filings. The next twelve entries in Panel (b) represent a diverse array of 
established AI -focused ETFs  (cf. Table  1), while panel (c) offers a benchmark comparison with the  
Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC). The performance metrics analyzed include average daily return percentage (𝑅𝑒𝑡), standard deviation (𝑆𝐷), skewness (𝑆𝑘𝑒𝑤 ), kurtosis (𝐾𝑢𝑟𝑡 ), alpha  (𝛼), beta  (𝛽), 
Sharpe Ratio (𝑆𝑅), Sortino Ratio (𝑆𝑜𝑅 ), maximum drawdown (𝑀𝑀𝐷), and omega ratio ω(𝑟𝑖). 
Collectively, these metrics provide a multifaceted view of each instrument's return characteristics, risk 
profile, volatility, and overall performance efficiency over the period from June 27, 2019, to September 
1, 2023.  
Examinin g the average daily returns presented in Table  5, our AI indices in Panel (a) exhibited a higher 
mean return (𝑟𝑒𝑡) of 0.076% compared to 0.056% for the existing AI ETFs in Panel (b). The Nasdaq 
Composite Index (IXIC) in Panel (c) reported an average daily return of 0.068%, falling between these 
two groups. This indicates that over the analyzed period, our AI indices ou tperformed both the market 
benchmark and the existing AI -themed ETFs in terms of raw returns. In terms of volatility, measured 
by the standard deviation (𝑆𝐷) of returns, both our AI indices (Panel a) and the AI ETFs (Panel b) 
displayed similar levels, with  mean standard deviations of 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. This suggests 
that the day -to-day fluctuations in returns were comparable across both groups, and neither exhibited 
significantly higher volatility than the other. The IXIC in Panel (c) had a slight ly lower standard 
deviation of 1.7%, indicating marginally less volatility than our AI indices.  
Analyzing skewness, both our AI indices in Panel (a) and the AI ETFs in Panel (b) exhibited negative 
skewness  (𝑆𝑘𝑒𝑤 ), with mean values of -0.44 and -0.42, res pectively, reflecting a slight propensity for 
returns to deviate negatively from the mean. The IXIC's skewness in Panel (c) was -0.43, comparable 
to both groups. Regarding kurtosis (𝐾𝑢𝑟𝑡 ), higher values were observed for the AI ETFs (mean of 8.56) 
in Pan el (b) compared to our AI indices (mean of 7.30) in Panel (a), while the IXIC in Panel (c) exhibited 
the highest kurtosis at 9.14. Elevated kurtosis indicates a greater likelihood of extreme returns (both 
positive and negative), suggesting that the AI ETFs  in Panel (b) were more susceptible to such events 
than our AI indices in Panel (a).  
Evaluating risk -adjusted returns using the Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio, our AI indices (Panel a) 
demonstrated superior performance, with mean (𝑆𝑅) and (𝑆𝑜𝑅 ) values of 0.039 and 0.037, 
respectively, compared to 0.029 and 0.028 for the AI ETFs (Panel b). This indicates that, per unit of 
risk, our AI indices provided, on average, higher returns than the existing AI ETFs. QTUM achieved 
the highest individual Sharpe Ratio (0 .046) and Sortino Ratio (0.044) amongst all existing AI ETFs in 
Panel (b). Analyzing beta (𝛽) coefficients, which measure sensitivity to market movements, our AI 
indices in Panel (a) had a higher mean beta of 0.961 compared to 0.623 for the AI ETFs in Panel  (b). 
This suggests that our indices were more closely correlated with the market benchmark (IXIC) and 
tended to move more in line with overall market trends. The higher beta of our indices (Panel a) is 
consistent with their construction from NASDAQ -listed  stocks. In contrast, the AI ETFs (Panel b) may 
include stocks from other exchanges, potentially reducing their correlation with the IXIC. Among the 
AI ETFs, WTAI had a notably low beta of 0.206, indicating a lower correlation with the market and 
potential  diversification benefits within a portfolio context.  In terms of maximum drawdown (𝑀𝑀𝐷 ), our AI indices in Panel (a) experienced a slightly lower mean 
𝑀𝑀𝐷  of 4.65% compared to 4.92% for the AI ETFs in Panel (b), suggesting a marginally smaller 
historical peak -to-trough loss. The IXIC in Panel (c) had an even lower MMD of 4.12%, indicating that 
the broader market experienced smaller drawdowns over the period. Lastly, the omega ratio, which 
assesses performance relative to a minimum required retur n, was equal on average for both our AI 
indices (Panel a) and the AI ETFs (Panel b) at 1.29. This indicates that, overall, both groups offered 
similar probabilities of achieving returns above the risk -free rate. The IXIC, however, had a higher 
omega ratio of 1.40, suggesting a better return per unit of risk compared to both AI -focused groups. On 
an individual level, among the AI ETFs, XAIX and GOAI both achieved the highest omega ratios of 
1.44, outperforming even the IXIC in this measure.  
Overall , our AI i ndices constructed through an NLP -based methodology outperformed existing AI ETFs 
by delivering higher average daily returns and demonstrated superior risk -adjusted performance, as 
evidenced by higher Sharpe and Sortino Ratios. Importantly, this enhanced p erformance did not come 
at the expense of increased volatility, as indicated by the comparable standard deviations between our 
indices and the ETFs. The higher beta values of our indices reflect a stronger alignment with overall 
market movements, which may  be advantageous for investors seeking exposure to the AI sector that 
closely tracks market trends. While certain AI ETFs exhibited unique characteristics —such as WTAI's 
low beta offering diversification benefits or QTUM and XAIX's strong individual perfor mance 
metrics —the overall findings suggest that our objective AI indices more effectively capture the 
innovative essence of the AI sector while maintaining a risk profile comparable to existing investment 
options. Consequently, our indices provide a compel ling alternative for investors interested in thematic 
AI investing, combining robust returns with acceptable risk levels in line with the broader market as 
represented by the IXIC, thereby highlighting the potential advantages of our data -driven approach i n 
constructing thematic investment indices.

5. Impli cations  
This study's primary contribution lies in the development and validation of a novel measure for the 
presence of AI -related disclosures in stocks, representing an advancement in the realm of thematic 
investing. By leveraging natural language process ing (NLP) techniques to analyze corporate filings, our 
measure offers a fresh perspective on the centrality of AI within publicly traded companies. Importantly, 
our approach to stock classification and valuation is not confined to AI; it is theoretically a pplicable to 
any technology or thematic focus, given its reliance on predefined keywords and publicly available 
disclosures. The validation of our AI measure, particularly against the backdrop of the launch of 
OpenAI's ChatGPT, supports its effectiveness a nd highlights its relevance in today's technology -driven 
investment landscape.  
A particularly striking finding is the competitiveness of our AI indices when compared to established 
AI-themed exchange -traded funds (ETFs). In several instances, our objectively constructed indices 
matched or even exceeded the performance metrics of trad itional AI ETFs, a noteworthy achievement 
considering the substantial expense ratios often associated with such investment products. This observation suggests that a straightforward, data -driven approach, as exemplified by our AI stock 
measure, can yield p erformance outcomes that are on par with or surpass those of more complex and 
costly investment vehicles. This finding is especially pertinent in the current investment environment, 
where cost efficiency and effective asset selection are of paramount impor tance.  
 
5.1. Implications for Theory  
The findings of this study have meaningful theoretical implications in the fields of finance and 
innovation, particularly concerning the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in contemporary markets. 
Firstly, our research contributes to the literature on ma rket reactions to technological advancements by 
providing a tangible metric that quantifies the market's perception of AI's value within stocks. By 
developing an AI measure based on natural language processing (NLP) analysis of corporate filings, 
we enhanc e existing theories on investor behavior in response to technological innovations (Aharon et 
al., 2022; Cahill et al., 2020) . Consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis (Fama, 1970) , our results 
suggest that markets can rapidly assimilate and resp ond to information regarding a company's 
engagement with AI technologies.  
Secondly, this study enriches the discourse on thematic investing (Somefun et al., 2023) . Our findings —
particularly the competitive performance of AI indices relative to establishe d AI -themed exchange -
traded funds (ETFs) —support the notion that thematic investments, when well -constructed and data -
driven, can be both effective and cost -efficient. This insight adds depth to the existing literature on 
thematic investments and ETFs (Blitz, 2021b; Dheeriya and Malladi, 2019; Methling and von Nitzsch, 
2019) , suggesting that objective, data -driven methodologies can enhance the effectiveness of thematic 
investment strategies.  
Thirdly, our research contributes to the strategic management li terature by more closely linking AI 
integration in corporate strategies with firm valuation and competitive advantage (Kar et al., 2021; 
Keding, 2021) . By demonstrating how AI integration is perceived and valued by the market, we expand 
on theories that explore psychological factors influencing investment decisions in behavioral finance 
(Bajo et al., 2023; Barber and Odean, 2013) . 
Fourthly, our results prompt a re -examination of the role of corporate disclosure in an era increasingly 
dominated by AI and  technology. They suggest the need for new frameworks to assess the quality and 
impact of such disclosures, particularly in technology -driven sectors. The NLP -based measure 
introduced in this study exemplifies how qualitative information can be transformed  into a quantifiable 
metric with significant market relevance. This resonates with the current shift towards more 
sophisticated data analysis methods in financial research and emphasizes the importance of 
technological literacy in financial market analysis . Finally, our methodology can be readily extended to other emerging technological themes, such as 
blockchain, the metaverse, or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics. Offering 
comparative insights contributes to a broader understanding of how  different technologies are valued 
in financial markets and provides a benchmark for existing indices and ETFs. This could inspire 
economic theories regarding the broader impact of technologies like AI on market structures, 
competition, and economic growth , particularly as AI continues to permeate various sectors.  
 
5.2. Implications for Practice  
Our study offers valuable insights for a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the financial sector, with 
implications ranging from investment strategy formulation to risk m anagement. Firstly, our study 
provides valuable insights for investors, particularly those interested in thematic investing. The marked 
outperformance of AI stocks following the launch of ChatGPT highlights the notable potential of AI as 
an investment them e. This remarkable performance reflects AI's escalating prominence in the 
investment landscape and offers new opportunities for portfolio diversification and growth. Investors 
can leverage the insights from our AI stock measure to identify companies deeply  integrated with AI 
technologies, potentially leading to enhanced returns and aligning their portfolios with cutting -edge 
technological advancements.  
Secondly, for fund managers and index providers, the findings present a compelling case for adopting 
more data-driven and transparent methodologies in constructing thematic indices. The competitive 
performance of the AI indices developed in this research —rooted in objective analyses using publicly 
available corporate data —suggests that such methods can yield o utcomes comparable to, or even 
surpass, those achieved by existing thematic ETFs. This approach could enhance competition among 
index providers, potentially resulting in reduced costs for ETFs and investors (An et al., 2023) . 
Moreover, the methodology em ployed in this study could revolutionize thematic index construction, 
serving as a blueprint for developing similar measures across other thematic areas. By harnessing 
technologies like NLP, fund managers and analysts can extract actionable insights from c orporate 
filings, enabling the formulation of more nuanced and accurate investment strategies.  
Thirdly, regulators and policymakers might find value in these findings, as they highlight the 
importance of transparent corporate disclosures in promoting marke t efficiency. Encouraging 
companies to provide detailed information about their engagement with emerging technologies like AI 
can facilitate more informed investment decisions and enhance investor protection. Additionally, the 
adoption of objective, data -driven approaches align with the broader trend toward increased 
transparency and accountability in financial markets. This could lead to the development of regulatory frameworks that standardize AI -related disclosures, further improving the quality of infor mation 
available to investors.  
Fourthly, our study has implications for risk management practices within financial institutions. The 
rapidly evolving nature of AI technologies introduces unique risks and uncertainties. By providing a 
quantifiable measure o f AI engagement, our methodology aids investors and risk managers in assessing 
the exposure of their portfolios to AI -related risks and opportunities. This enables more effective risk 
assessment and the development of strategies to mitigate potential adver se impacts associated with 
technological disruptions.  
Finally, our research emphasizes the practical utility of applying advanced analytical techniques to 
publicly available data, offering a cost -effective and transparent alternative for  financial technology  
investors. The demonstrated feasibility and success of a straightforward, data -driven approach to 
thematic investing suggest that such methods hold the potential to outperform traditional, more costly 
strategies. This highlights the value of tec hnological literacy and innovation in financial analysis, 
encouraging stakeholders to embrace data analytics and NLP techniques in investment decision -making 
processes.  
 
5.3. Limitations and Future Research  
This study, while providing valuable insights, is subj ect to several limitations that offer avenues for 
future research and refinement. Firstly, our reliance on publicly available corporate disclosures, 
specifically 10 -K filings, means that our quantitative analysis may not capture all dimensions of a 
company 's engagement with AI. A closer examination of these filings reveals that the term "AI" is used 
in varied contexts. Some companies detail how they have integrated AI into their business operations, 
while others merely mention competitors' use of AI or expr ess intentions to explore AI in the future. 
Future research could enhance the quality of these metrics by incorporating qualitative assessments or 
employing more advanced natural language processing techniques to differentiate the context and depth 
of AI m entions (Frankel et al., 2022) . 
Secondly, the utilization of a single data source presents limitations. Companies could theoretically 
manipulate their AI engagement metrics by frequently mentioning AI without substantive involvement, 
a phenomenon known a s "AI washing." Indeed, in March 2024, the SEC charged two investment 
advisers for disclosing misleading statements about AI utilization (SEC, 2024) , indicating that such 
manipulation is a genuine concern. To mitigate this issue, future studies should co nsider incorporating 
additional data sources, such as research and development (R&D) expenditures (Mishra et al., 2022) , 
technology sentiment analyses (Bonaparte, 2023) , or other AI -related keywords like "machine learning." This multi -faceted approach could develop a more robust and comprehensive measure of AI 
engagement, reducing the potential for manipulation and improving the reliability of the classification.  
Thirdly, the market reaction to the launch of ChatGPT -3 launch supports our AI stock classi fication; 
this event -based approach provides valuable insights into immediate market perceptions and responses, 
but it may not fully capture broader market dynamics or external factors influencing stock performance. 
Investor sentiment can be heavily influe nced by short -term news cycles and hype, potentially skewing 
the perceived value of AI stocks. Therefore, future research should complement this event study with 
more holistic analyses that consider a range of market influences, longer time horizons, and m ultiple 
events to provide a more comprehensive understanding of AI stock performance and classification.  
Fourthly, the focus on NASDAQ -listed firms presents a geographical limitation. Since the NASDAQ 
predominantly features U.S. -based technology companies,  our analysis may overlook AI investment 
opportunities in other global markets, including emerging economies where AI technology is 
increasingly significant. This narrow focus restricts our understanding of the global AI investment 
landscape. Future resear ch should expand the scope to include diverse markets and assess different 
types of corporate disclosures beyond 10 -K filings, such as annual reports, earnings calls, and 
international regulatory filings, to capture a more accurate and comprehensive pictur e of global AI 
engagement.  
Lastly, while our measure effectively identifies AI -centric stocks, it represents only a starting point in 
the complex task of evaluating AI's role and impact within companies and financial instruments. Our 
methodology is primarily quantitative, and incorp orating qualitative assessments and more 
sophisticated metrics could enhance the precision of the AI engagement measure. For example, adapting 
methods from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) research —such as developing an AI -
specific dictionary si milar to the ESG dictionary by Baier et al., (2020)  —could provide deeper insights 
into the quality and depth of AI integration within firms. Incorporating relevant metrics like research 
and development (R&D) expenses (Mishra et al., 2022) , sentiment a nalysis (Bonaparte, 2023) , or 
additional AI -related keywords such as "machine learning" could also refine the measure. We propose 
that the quality of the AI measure can be further enhanced by conducting a broader and more in -depth 
examination of how AI i s integrated and operationalized within the business models and strategies of 
these companies. Nevertheless, given the promising outcomes produced by our current approach, it is 
reasonable to infer that a more comprehensive and nuanced model could yield hi ghly competitive 
results.  
 6. Conclusion  
This study introduces an objective, data -driven methodology for classifying AI stocks based on publicly 
available corporate disclosures. By leveraging natural language processing techniques to analyze annual 
10-K filings from 3,395 NASDAQ -listed firms between 2011 and 2023, we quantified each company's 
engagement with AI technologies. Our approach involved creating both a binary indicator of AI 
mention and a weighted AI score that reflects the frequency and context  of AI -related terms in these 
disclosures. Using these AI engagement metrics, we constructed four AI stock indices: the Equally 
Weighted AI Index (AII), the Size -Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time -Discounted AI Indices 
(TAII05 and TAII5X). These indice s differ in how they weigh companies based on their AI involvement 
and account for historical disclosures, offering alternative perspectives on AI investment opportunities. 
We then compared the performance of these indices against 12 existing AI -themed ETF s, analyzing 
their risk -return profiles, market reactions to the ChatGPT launch, and overall investment performance.  
Our validation through an event study centered on the launch of ChatGPT confirmed that companies 
with higher degrees of AI engagement exhib ited more significant positive abnormal returns. This 
finding demonstrates that our objective measures effectively capture market perceptions of AI 
involvement. Regression analyses further supported the validity of our metrics, revealing a significant 
predictive power of our AI measures on the cumulative average abnormal returns observed. 
Comparative analysis showed that our objectively constructed AI indices perform on par with, or even 
surpass, existing AI -themed ETFs in terms of market response and inves tment performance. This 
suggests that our methodology offers a reliable and market -responsive approach to creating AI stock 
indices, providing investors with a viable alternative or complement to existing AI -themed investment 
products. Such an approach cou ld enhance competition among index providers and potentially reduce 
ETF expense ratios, benefiting investors seeking exposure to the AI sector.  
Our study contribut es to the literature on financial markets and corporate disclosures, particularly 
focusing on  AI technology. By introducing an objective, data -driven approach to classifying AI stocks 
based on company filings, we address a notable gap in current research. Building upon foundational 
work on how corporate information influences stock valuations, our  results enhance the understanding 
of market reactions to technology disclosures in corporate filings. Specifically, by analyzing the market 
reaction to the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT as a validation measure for AI -focused stocks, we 
contribute to research  on technology launches and their impact on financial markets. Overall, our study 
presents a robust framework for objectively identifying and evaluating AI -focused investments. By 
utilizing NLP -based analysis of corporate disclosures, we create data -driven  AI engagement metrics 
that inform the construction of competitive AI stock indices. Our methodology addresses the opacity 
and subjectivity found in existing AI -themed ETFs and offers empirical support through market reaction 
analyses. As AI continues to e volve and impact various sectors, our methodologies and findings remain relevant for understanding and capitalizing on AI -related investment opportunities, benefiting both 
academia and the investment industry.
