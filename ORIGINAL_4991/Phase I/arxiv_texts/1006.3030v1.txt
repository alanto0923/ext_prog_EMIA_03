Abstract
We determine the thresholds for the number of variables, number o f
clauses, number of clause intersection pairs and the maximum clause de-
gree of a k-CNF formula that guarantees satisﬁability under the assumption
that everytwoclauses shareat most αvariables. Moreformally, we call these
formulas α-intersecting and deﬁne, for example, a threshold µi(k,α) for the
number of clause intersection pairs i, such that every α-intersecting k-CNF
formulainwhichatmost µi(k,α)pairsofclausesshareavariableissatisﬁable
and there exists an unsatisﬁable α-intersecting k-CNF formula with µm(k,α)
such intersections. We provide a lower bound for these thresholds based on
the Lov´ asz Local Lemma and a nearly matching upper bound by con struct-
ing an unsatisﬁable k-CNF to show that µi(k,α) =˜Θ(2k(2+1/α)). Similar
thresholds are determined for the number of variables ( µn=˜Θ(2k/α)) and
the number of clauses ( µm=˜Θ(2k(1+1
α))) (see [10] for an earlierbut indepen-
dent report on this threshold). Our upper bound construction giv es a family
of unsatisﬁable formula that achieve all four thresholds simultaneo usly.

1In this paper we investigate a simple class of criteria that c an guarantee satisﬁa-
bility of a given k-CNF formula. We consider threshold criteria, i.e., for sev eral
quantities connected to a CNF (like the number of clauses, va riables or variable
intersections) we determineamaximum magnitudeleading to satisﬁable formulas.
We would like to determine the exact threshold of such quanti ties, in the sense
that there exist unsatisﬁable formulas for which this quant ity is greater than the
threshold. A tightly determined threshold can be used as a si mple satisﬁability
test: given a formula F, determine or count the speciﬁc quantities in Fand de-
clareFsatisﬁable if one of these quantities is below the threshold . Observe that
such thresholds help in deciding satisﬁability only if the c onsidered quantity are
below the threshold. The problem of deciding satisﬁability when all these quan-
tities are above the threshold is still a hard problem.
One such threshold that we consider is the number of clauses m. We denote this
threshold by µm(k) and it denotes the smallest number of clauses in an unsatisﬁ -
able formula. The trivial lower bound of µm(k)≥2kis easily seen: each formula
that consists of less than 2kclauses is satisﬁable since each clause eliminates only
one out of the 2kpossible satisfying assignments. On the other hand there is an
unsatisﬁable k-CNF formula with 2kclauses, namely the formula consisting of
all possible 2kclauses (all positive/negative literal combinations) on kvariables.
Hence,µm(k) = Θ(2k).
Yet another prominent threshold is the maximum clause degree ∆ of ak-CNF for-
mula, i.e. the maximum number of clauses that share at least o ne variable with
a ﬁxed clause. The complete formula on kvariables once again has maximum
degree 2kand gives an easy upper bound for this threshold. On the other hand
an application of the powerful Lov´ asz Local Lemma [3] shows that every formula
with ∆<2k/eis satisﬁable leading to the conclusion that µ∆= Θ(2k).
In this paper we focus on satisﬁability-threshold for a spec ial class of formulas
which guarantee that two clauses intersect only in a bounded number (henceforth
we denote this by α) of variables. These formulas are a natural extension of
linear CNF formulas, i.e., formulas with α= 1, which have been introduced in [9].
The naming and concept of linear CNF formula comes from hyper graphs with
bounded intersections as studied for example in [3]. Intuit ively, the restriction
to bounded intersection makes it harder to build conﬂicting clauses which lead
to unsatisﬁability. And indeed it was the original goal of th e authors to prove
a higher satisﬁability-threshold for ∆ in linear k-CNF using stronger versions
of the LLL, e.g., the soft-core LLL version of [13]. While it t urned out that the
satisﬁability thresholdfor∆remains ˜Θ(2k)evenforlinearCNFswegot interesting
2dependencies on αin the thresholds for other quantities, namely the number of
variables, the number of clauses and the number of clause int ersection pairs.
2 Related work
This paper builds highly on the techniques developed by Erd˝ os and Lov´ asz in the
classical paper “Problems and results on 3-chromatic hyper graphs and some re-
latedquestions”[3]. OurproofsarebuiltonthepowerfulLo v´ aszLocalLemmaand
also make use of and extend the shrinking operation (see Sect ion 5) that was used
in [3] to construct interesting linear hypergraphs. Indepe ndently but roughly a
year beforetheauthorsconducted thisresearch thepaper[1 0] byDominik Scheder
examined the satisﬁability threshold for the number of clau ses/constraints apply-
ing essentially the same techniques as here and in [3]. While Scheder considers
multi-value constraint satisfaction problems – essential ly a non-binary variant of
CNF formula—he restricts himself to the threshold µm. All results presented here
directly extend to these multi-value CSPs too and to our know ledge this paper is
the ﬁrst to states the thresholds for the number of clause int ersection pairs, vari-
ables and the max degree explicitly. More complicated algeb raic constructions
based on ideas of Kuzjurin [6] and Kostochka and R¨ odl [5] wor k for the restricted
caseα= 1 and can be found in Lemma 2.2. of [11] without explicit stat ement of
thresholds. Most notably, we use the α-shrinking procedure not just in the lower
bound but apply it to a maximal ( k+α)-uniform α-intersecting formula in our
upper bound construction. This is the key to obtaining bound s on the number
of clause intersections and gives an unsatisﬁable α-intersecting formula that is
extremal (up to log-factors) in all considered quantities.
Another very interesting related work by Scheder and Zumste inis thepaper “How
many conﬂicts does it need to be Unsatisﬁable” [12] in which u pper and lower
bounds on the threshold for conﬂicts are given. The notion of a conﬂict is closely
related to clause intersections. Instead of counting the pa irs of clauses that share
a variable the number of conﬂict only counts clause pairs in w hich at least one
variable is shared in an opposite literal. The reason why con ﬂicts are interesting
is because the lopsided version of the Lov´ asz Local Lemma [4 ] can be applied to
k-CNF formulas in which each clause is involved in at most 2k/econﬂicts and thus
guarantees their satisﬁability. In contrast to the nearly t ight threshold µi(k,α) =
˜Θ(2k(2+1/α)) for clause intersections in α-intersecting formula established here,
the conﬂict threshold is much harder to determine: the best k nown result for
α=kisω(2.69k)≤µc(k,k)≤O(4klog2k
k) [12].
33 Preliminaries
A hypergraph is k-uniform if all edges contain exactly kvertices. Two edges
are called intersecting if they share at least one vertex and a hypergraph is
calledα-intersecting if any two intersecting edges share at most αvertices. A
1-intersecting hypergraph is called linear. Theedge intersection pairs of a
hypergraph are all pairs of edges that are intersecting. The degree of a vertex
is the number of edges it appears in and the degree of an edge is the number
of edges it intersects with.
Everyk-CNF formula Finduces ak-uniform (multi)-hypergraph GF= (V,E)
whereVis the set of variables and the edge (multi)-set Econtains an hyperedge
over vertices {v1,···,vk}if and only if there exists a clause consisting of the cor-
responding variables. This gives a one-to-one mapping betw een clauses and edges
in the induced hypergrah and we adopt all previously introdu ced hypergraph ter-
minology for k-CNF formula accordingly, e.g., we deﬁne clause intersecti on pairs
as all pairs of clauses that intersect in at least one variabl e.
Throughoutthispaperweareinterestedinsatisﬁabilityth resholdsfor α-intersecting
k-CNF formula. We consider the following quantities: number of clauses m,
number of variables n, maximum degree ∆ and number of clause intersection
pairsi. Denote the thresholds for a quantity qwithµq(α,k). Asatisﬁability
threshold µq(α,k) is the smallest number such that there exists an unsatisﬁab le
α-intersecting k-CNF with q=µm(α,k). Phraseddiﬀerently it is thelargest num-
ber such that every α-intersecting k-CNF formula with q < µq(α,k) is satisﬁable.
Our lower bounds to the thresholds are based on a classical ap plication of the
Lov´ asz Local Lemma [3] and its more recent constructive alg orithmic versions
that give randomized [7] and deterministic [8, 1] algorithm s:
Theorem 1. Everyk-CNF with maximum clause degree ∆at most2k
eis satisﬁ-
able and there is an eﬃcient algorithm to ﬁnd such an assignme nt.
4 Results
We present lower bounds (Theorem 2) and nearly matching cons tructive upper
bounds (Theorem 3) that determine all thresholds µi,µm,µn,µ∆up to log-factors
(Theorem 4). Our lower bound in Theorem 2 consists of an algor ithm based on
Theorem 1 that eﬃciently ﬁnds a satisfying assignment for an yα-intersecting k-
CNF formula with few clause intersection pairs, variables o r clauses. The upper
4bound in Theorem 3 proves the existence of unsatisﬁable form ulas which have
only slightly more clause intersections, variables and cla uses. Note that while
our proof of Theorem 2 is algorithmic, one needs an eﬃcient im plementation of
Lemma 7 to make Theorem 3 constructive(see also [11]). We sus pect that some
of the bounds below can be improved by O(k)-factors but since all bounds are
exponential in kwe did not optimize for these polylogarithmic factors.

In the following ˜Θ(x) means Θ( x(logx)c) for some absolute (positive or negative)
constant c. Combining the above two theorems yields good estimates for the
thresholds:
Corollary 4. The thresholds for satisﬁability are:
•number of clause intersections: µi=˜Θ(2k(2+1/α))
5•number of variables: µn=˜Θ(2k/α)
•number of clauses: µm=˜Θ(2k(1+1
α))
•maximum degree: µ∆=˜Θ(2k)
5 Shrinking and Maximal α-intersecting Hypergraphs
This section contains useful lemmas about hypergraphs need ed to prove the main
theorems. One operation that will be particularly helpful f or both the lower and
the upper bound is the β-shrinking operation. The shrinking operation creates
ak-uniform hypergraph H′from a (k+β)-uniform hypergraph Hby deleting the
βvertices of maximum degree from each edge breaking ties arbi trarily. Shrinking
is similarly deﬁned for ( k+β)-CNF formulas where the variables with highest
degree are deleted from each clause. The next lemma shows tha t a high degree
vertex can survive the β-shrinking procedure to remain a high degree vertex only
if many such high degree vertices are present in the original hypergraph.
Lemma 5. LetHbe a(k+α)-uniform α-intersecting hypergraph and H′be the
result of α-shrinking H. IfH′has a vertex of degree d, thenHhas more than
d1/αvertices of degree at least d.
Proof.Letvbe the vertex in H′of degree d. SinceH′was created by shrinking H
there are at least dedges in Hin which vis present but did not get deleted. We
call the set of those edges E; then we know that |E| ≥d. From each edge e∈ E,
exactlyαvertices got deleted all of which are of degree of at least d. We claim
that the mapping that maps each e∈ Eto thisα-sized set of deleted vertices is
injective:
Suppose two edges e1,e2∈ Eget mapped to the same α-sized set of vertices.
Then, the edges e1ande2intersect in these αvertices; furthermore they also in-
tersect in the vertex vand thus intersect in α+1 vertices. This is a contradiction
to theα-intersecting property of H.
Injectivity gives us that there are |E| ≥ddiﬀerent α-sized subsets of vertices
which got deleted instead of vwhile shrinking. All vertices in those subsets must
have degree at least dby deﬁnition of the shrinking operation. Furthermore if N
is the number of distinct vertices in those subsets then we ha ved≤/parenleftbigN
α/parenrightbig
< Nα.
Therefore there are at least N > d1/αvertices with degree at least dinH.
6The next lemma proves that any maximal α-intersecting hypergraph on nvertices
must have a large number of edges. It uses a bound on the Tur´ an number that is
due to de Caen [2]. The Tur´ an number T(n,k,r) forr-uniform hypergraphs with
nvertices is the smallest number of edges possible such that e very set of kvertices
contains at least one edge. This number was determined for gr aphs by Tur´ an [14]
and extended to hypergraphs by himself in the report ”Resear ch Problems”[15].
Lemma 6. Every maximal α-intersecting hypergraph Honnvertices has at least
m≥(n
α+1)
(k
α+1)2edges.
Proof.LetHbe a maximal α-intersecting hypergraph on medges. Since His
α-intersecting each of the/parenleftbign
α+1/parenrightbig
subsets of vertices of size α+1 is covered by at
most one distinct hyperedge of H. Also,Hcovers exactly m/parenleftbigk
α+1/parenrightbig
distinct subsets
of sizeα+ 1 inH. Ifm/parenleftbigk
α+1/parenrightbig
< T(n,k,α+1) the α+ 1-uniform hypergraph
consisting of all covered α+1-size subsets has less than T(n,k,α+1) edges and
therefore ∃ak-subsetKthat does not contain any covered edge. This k-subset
can be added as an edges into Hwhile preserving it to be α-intersecting. Indeed,
if some edge eintersects Kin at least α+1 vertices, then the corresponding set
of vertices is covered contradicting the choice of K. Thus if m <T(n,k,α+1)
(k
α+1)then
His not maximal α-intersecting. To ﬁnish we use a lower bound of de Caen [2]
on the Tur´ an number: T(n,k,α+1)≥n−k+1
n−α/parenleftbign
α+1/parenrightbig
//parenleftbigk−1
α/parenrightbig
; plugging this in gives
the desired result.
We remark that the same result also appears in Scheder [10] wi th somewhat
simpler and self-contained proof.
6 A Constructive Lower Bound
This section gives the proof for the lower bound in Theorem 2:
Proof.(of Theorem 2)
We prove that every α-intersecting k-CNFFis either satisﬁable by Theorem 1 af-
terα-shrinking it or it must have large clause intersection pair s, variables, clauses
and a high maximum degree contradicting the hypothesis abou t the formula F.
LetF′be the resulting ( k−α)-CNF we get from α-shrinking F. If all variables
inF′have degree less than d= 2(k−α)/ekthen the Lov´ asz Local Lemma guaran-
tees that F′is satisﬁable and Theorem 1 states that a satisfying assignm ent can
7be eﬃciently found. Note that a satisfying assignment for F′is also a satisfying
assignment for F.
In the other case, suppose F′has at least one variable of degree d. Then, Lemma
5 shows that Fmust have at least d1/αvariables of degree at least d.
To count the number of clause intersection pairs in F, we count the intersections
of clauses containing one of the d1/αhigh degree variables. For each such variable
the clauses containing it induce a clique with ( d−1)2/2 intersections. Taking the
disjoint union of these intersections we get at least ( d−1)2+1/α/2 intersections
but overcount each intersection up to α-times since two clauses can intersect in
up toαvariables. Therefore Fhas at least1
2α(d−1)2+1/αintersections.
To count the number of clauses in Fwe look at the union of the clauses containing
one of the d1/αvariables. There are at least d1+1/αclauses in the non disjoint
union and each clause can get added because of each of its kvariables at most
once. Thus Fhas at least d1+1/α/kclauses.
Finally it is clear that Fhas at least d1/αvariables.
7 Upper bounds for the thresholds
This section gives the proof for the upper bounds in Theorem 2 .
Before we prove the theorem itself, the following lemma give s a general way to
transform a suﬃciently dense k-uniform hypergraph into an unsatisﬁable k-CNF
formula by iteratively taking a hyperedge and greedily choo sing positive or nega-
tive literals for the variables:
Lemma 7. If there is a k-uniform hypergraph Honnvertices and at least m=
n2kedges than there exists an unsatisﬁable k-CNFFinducing H.
Proof.Denote the vertices in Hbyv1,...,vnand associate with them, the vari-
ablesx1,···,xnthat will occur in F.
We will denote A ∈ {0,1}nto be an assignment if we pick an assignment of val-
ues to variables xby setting xi=Ai. We say that a clause coversan assignment
A ∈ {0,1}nif it is not satisﬁed by the assignment. We will iteratively c reate
a clause for every edge in Hgreedily covering the maximum number of yet un-
covered assignments. We have to show that in the end all 2nassignments are
8covered. Consequently, the conjunction of the created clau ses forms an unsatisﬁ-
ablek-CNF.
We pick edges efromHin an arbitrary order. We want to create a clause for
eon thekvariables associated with the kvertices in e. For each variable we
have the choice to pick the positive or the negative literal. These are 2kdiﬀerent
choices and the assignments covered by two diﬀerent choices a re disjoint. Since
every assignment can be covered in this way the assignments g et partitioned into
2kparts. Simple averaging then guarantees that there exists a choice covering at
least 1/2kfraction of the assignments not covered so far. After miterations of
greedily creating clauses covering the maximal number of un covered assignments
is at most 2n/parenleftbig

(1−2−k)2−k/parenrightBign
<1. With all assignments covered
the created formula Fis unsatisﬁable and by construction also induces Has
required.
The above lemma shifts the focus towards ﬁnding a suitable de nsek-uniform hy-
pergraph in order to ﬁnd an unsatisfying k-CNF. The following proof of Theorem
2 shows that α-shrinking a maximal α-intersecting ( k+α)-uniform hypergraph
results in hypergraphs with nice additional extremal prope rties. Furthermore
choosing a large number of vertices results in hypergraphs t hat obey the bound
in Lemma 7 and can thus be transformed into the desired unsati sﬁablek-CNF.
Proof.(of Theorem 3)
We create the formula by applying Lemma 7 to an α-intersecting hypergraph. We
obtain this hypergraph by α-shrinking a maximal α-intersecting ( k+α)-uniform
hypergraph. Observe that it makes the resulting hypergraph k-uniform.
We choose n=α/parenleftbig
2k+αk2(α+1)/parenrightbig1/αand build a α-intersecting ( k+α)-uniform
hypergraph on nvertices. The choice of nis such that Lemma 6 guarantees that
we can ﬁnd a k+α-uniform hypergraph Hwith
m=nα+1
k2(α+1)αα=α2(k+α)(1+1/α)k2(1+1/α)= 2k+αn
edges. This is suﬃciently large number of edges to construct an unsatisﬁable for-
mulaFfor hypergraph Husing Lemma 7. Having constructed H, weα-shrink it
to obtain hypergraph H′and its correspoding formula F′. Note that F′is unsat-
isﬁable because Fis unsatisﬁable. The signiﬁcant advantage about H′obtained
this way is that it has guarantees on the maximum degree and on the number of
clause intersections. More precisely, we claim that H′has maximum degree less
9than (mk)1/(1+1/α). Suppose that after the shrinking there is a vertex of degree
d >(m(k+α))1/(1+1/α). Lemma 5 shows that in this case Hcontains at least
d1/αvertices of degree larger than d. The disjoint union of the edges containing
those vertices has size at least d1+1/αand each edge gets counted at most ( k+α)
times this way. Therefore Hwould have at least d1+1/α/(k+α)> medges — a
contradiction.
Lemma 7 transforms the hypergraph Hinto an unsatisﬁable k-CNF formula F.
This formula has nvariables and medges since shrinking preserves these quanti-
ties. Furthermore, the maximum degree ∆ of Fis at most ( mk)1/(1+1/α)which
also implies that the number of clause intersections is at mo stm∆.
