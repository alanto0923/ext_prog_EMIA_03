 ABSTRACT  
We use the Grossman & Stiglitz  (1980) framewor k to build a reference portfolio  for uninformed  
investors  and employ  this portfolio to  assess  the performance of actively managed  equity mu-
tual funds . We propose an empirical methodology to construct this reference portfolio  using  the 
information on prices  and supply . We  show that mutual funds provide, on average, an insignif-
icant  alpha of 23 basis points per year when considering this portfolio  as a reference . With the 
stock market index as a proxy for the market portfolio , the average fund alpha is negati ve and 
highly significant, −128 basis points per year. The results are robust when considering various 
subsets of funds based on their characteristics and their degree of selectivity. In line with ra-
tional expectations equilibrium models considering asymmetrically informed investors  and par-
tially revealing equilibrium prices , our study supports  that active management adds value for 
uniformed investors .

RESUME  
Nous utilisons le modèle  de Grossman & Stiglitz (1980) pour construire un portefeuille de ré-
férence pour les investisseurs non informés et nous utilisons ce portefeuille pour évaluer la 
performance  des fonds communs d e placement en actions , gérés activement. Nous proposons 
une méthodologie empirique pour construire ce portefeuille de référence en utilisant des infor-
mations sur les prix  des actions et l'offre  en titres. Nous montrons alors que les fo nds communs 
de placement fournissent, en moyenne, un alpha non significatif  de 23 points de base par an 
lorsqu e l'on considère ce portefeuille comme référence. Avec l'indice du marché comme proxy 
du portefeuille de marché, l e alpha moyen des fonds est néga tif et hautement significatif  (-128 
points de base par an ). Les résultats sont identiques  lorsque l'on considère différents sous -en-
sembles de fonds en fonction de leurs caractéristiques et de leur degré de sélectivité. En accord 
avec les modèles d'équilibr e à anticipations  rationnelles  considérant  des investisseurs différem-
ment  informés et des prix d'équilibre partiellement révélateurs , nos résultats indiquent que la 
gestion active des fonds mutuels est performante du point des investisseurs non informés .

 The mutual fund industry has shown r apid growth over the last decades, and this growth is 
particularly spectacular for actively managed equity mutual funds. Using data from the CRSP 
Survivor -Bias-Free US Mutual Fund  from  1968  to 2020 , we document  a 12.67%  average an-
nual growth rate of total net assets for US -domestic actively managed equity mutual funds . 
Whether active mutual fund management adds value for investors is of considerable interest to  
academics and practitioners.  
Many  academic studies analy ze the performance of actively managed e quity mutual funds and 
find pessimistic results4. In most empirical specifications, these studies use the market index as 
the main reference portfolio  for measuring mutual funds’ performance. Funds appear to deliver, 
on average, a negative and significant market -risk-adjusted return (alpha). The conventional 
view is that the performance of active mutual fund management is negative . An important and 
long-debated question remains unanswered: Why do investors continue to buy shares of actively 
managed mutual f unds knowing that their performance is negative ?  
Our study answers  this question by mobilizing rational expectations equilibrium (REE) models5 
considering asymmetrically informed investors and partially revealing assets’ prices. These 
models  provide  a relevant theoretical framework for analy zing mutual fund performance. In 
particular, the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) model, hereafter GS, considers the existence of 
two groups of investors on the market: informed investors and uninformed ones. Mutual fund 
managers can be thought of as representing the group of informed investors in the GS model 
while their clients can be considered as the group of uninformed investors.  
In this paper, we claim that the market portfolio is not the correct reference portfolio  for as-
sessing portfolio performance, neither from the perspective of informed investors (mutual fund 
managers) nor from the perspective of uninformed ones (mutual fund clients). In a market with 
informational asymmetries between groups of investors, each gr oup has its own efficient fron-
tier, asset -pricing model, and optimal portfolio condition al on the available information . This 
is a well -known result of REE models. In particular, the optimal portfolio of uninformed inves-

as well as Chen  et al.  (2000).  
5 Grossman  (1976), Grossman & Stiglitz (1980) and Hellwig  (1980) develop these types of models in 
one-risky -asset framewo rks. Admati  (1985), O'Hara  (2003), and Easley & O'Hara (2004), among others , 
extend these models in multi -risky -asset frameworks . 4 
 tors under -weighs (respectively over weighs) assets with high (respectively low) degrees of in-
formation asymmetry. The performance of any asset, and in particular that of mutual funds, 
must be measured relative to this reference portfolio  if one takes the perspective of an unin-
formed inves tor. Using  the stock market  index as a proxy for the market portfolio in empirical 
studies would  translate into a biased  performance (alpha). In particular, t his may explain the 
pessimistic results about mutual funds’ performance obtained in the literature.  
Our objective in this paper is to use the reference portfolio of uninformed investors to assess 
the performance of actively managed mutual funds from the perspective of these investors , 
considered clients . As far as we know, our paper is the first that uses such a  portfolio  derived 
from REE models to assess mutual fund performance. We designate this portfolio  “UIRP” for 
"Uninformed Investor’s Reference Portfolio ".  
Specifically, our paper brings two major contributions to the literature. The first is theore tical; 
we build on existing multi -asset generalizations of the GS model (Jimenez -Garcès, 2004) to 
build  “UIRP ”. To achieve this goal, we proceed in three steps. First, we explicitly derive the 
asset -pricing model from the uninformed  investor s' perspective.  From their perspective, the ex-
pected return of an asset in excess of the risk -free rate equals the asset’s beta with respect to 
UIRP  multiplied by the expected return of this reference portfolio  in excess of the risk -free rate 
(UIRP  risk premium). The bet a with respect to the market portfolio and the market risk pre-
mium, which are derived from the classical CAPM, is irrelevant for pricing assets from the 
uninformed investor’s perspective; the relevant reference portfolio  is UIRP . The second step is 
to dete rmine UIRP  based on unobservable  REE parameters. We analy ze particular cases and 
perform simulation analyses show ing that UIRP  under -weighs  (respectively overweighs) assets 
with high  (respectively low) levels of information asymmetry. The third step consis ts in deter-
mining UIRP  based on observable  variables. For measuring the degree of information asym-
metry, we use the “Proxy E(r)” measure proposed by Burlacu  et al.  (2012). This measure ob-
tains by projecting individual common stock returns on their prices a nd the prices of relevant 
industry portfolios. Based on a simulation analysis, we prove the relevancy of this measure for 
building UIRP .  
The second contribution of this paper is empirical . It consists in analy zing the performance of 
domestic U.S. actively  managed equity mutual funds by using UIRP  as a reference portfolio . 
To achieve this goal, we proceed in three steps. First, we use CRSP common stock data on the 
U.S. market to compute “Proxy E(r)” for the 53  years  from January 1968 to December 2020. 5 
 Secon d, we construct UIRP  by following the guidelines from the theory. This portfolio is not 
investable as it does not use only ex-ante publicly available infor mation  (beginning -of-period 
prices ) but also information on supply (stock capitalization), which does not represent ex-ante 
observable information for uninformed investors  in the theoretical framework considered here. 
Rather than giving a tool for p ortfolio management to these in vestors, our aim in building this 
portfolio is to provid e a tool allowing them to assess the performance of actively managed 
portfolio s on an ex-post basis.  Third, we analy ze the performance of 26,407 domestic U.S. ac-
tively managed equity mutual funds  existing  from January 1968 to December 2020 by using 
CRSP survivorship -free mutua l fund data. The mutual fund’s performance is estimated with 
UIRP  and then is compared to the results obtained using alternative portfolios  such as the mar-
ket index (Jensen, 1968) or other widely used factor -mimicking portfolios ( Carhart , 1997).  
Our empir ical analysis is deployed for mutual funds overall and categories of mutual funds 
based on their characteristics such as expenses, turnover, total net assets, or degree of selectiv-
ity. Using UIRP , we find that actively managed equity mutual funds offer their clients a non -
significant alpha of 23 basis points per year . Our results are robust when considering specific 
categories of mutual funds based on their characteristics. In addition, we do not find significant 
performance for groups of mutual funds based  on their degree of active management (selectiv-
ity). Using the market index as a reference portfolio  provides a different picture but  close r to 
that offered by the existing literature. The average actively managed equity fund provide s a 
negative and highly  significant alpha of -128 basis points per year. We also find negative per-
formance for categories of mutual funds based on their characteristics and degree of selectivity.  
Overall, our results are in line with the theory and support the value of active ma nagement. Our 
study joins a branch of the literature that provides a more optimistic view about mutual fund 
active management. Some studies argue that the poor performance of actively managed funds , 
as put forward by the previous literature , can be explain ed by the services that mutual funds 
bring to investors. For example, Edelen  (1999) considers the costs associated with the liquidity 
service provided by mutual funds. By controlling for such costs, the abnormal returns obtained 
by mutual fund clients beco me insignificant. Other empirical studies measure fund performance 
at the portfolio’s stockholdings level. Wermers  (2000) shows that the portfolio of common 
stocks held by actively managed equity mutual funds outperforms the stock market. The over -
performa nce obtained at the fund’s stockholding level just compensates for mutual fund ex-6 
 penses and transaction costs. Wermers  (2000) concludes that this result is in line with the pre-
dictions of the GS model. Our study achieves the same conclusion as in Wermers  (2000), but 
our approach differs . We argue that the poor performance put forward by the literature on ac-
tively managed funds comes from the fact that this literature uses a reference portfolio  that is 
unsuitable  if one takes the perspective of REE models wi th asymmetrically informed investors.  
The paper’s structure is as follows. Section 1 derives the uninformed investor’s asset pricing 
model and his optimal  portfolio  based on a generalization of the GS model in a multi -asset 
framework. In section 2, we prop ose an empirical methodology to construct UIRP . Section 3 
analy zes mutual fund performance using UIRP  as a reference portfolio  together with other 
widely used reference portfolio s. The last section concludes and offers some avenues for future 
research.  
1 BUILDING UIRP : THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  
This section starts by justifying our approach. Then, it briefly describes  the multi -asset version 
of the GS model developed by Jimenez -Garcès (2004) by focusing on the two main issues of 
interest: What is the asset -pricin g model, and what is the reference portfolio  for an uninformed 
investor in this model?  This section ends by proposing a methodology to build UIRP  using 
observable variables. Subsequently, we will use UIRP to measure fund performance from the 
perspective of  uninformed investors, considered as clients buying shares of funds. This repre-
sents the main objective of this paper.  
1.1 JUSTIFICATION FOR THE  USE OF REE  MODELS  
Consider an “uninformed” investor who envisages the possibility of buying shares of actively 
managed mutual funds. What is the asset -pricing model from the perspective of this investor? 
What is his optimal portfolio? The traditional Sharpe –Lintner –Mossin capital asset pricing 
model (CAPM) assumes that all investors possess homogeneous information abo ut the future 
returns of market -traded securities. It predict s that the expected return of any asset depends only 
on its systematic (market) risk and that all investors hold a combination of the risk -free asset 
and the market portfolio. In this framework, the optimal  portfolio strategy for any investor is to 
buy-and-hold the market portfolio.  
The empirical literature does not provide strong support for the frictionless  CAPM 's predictions, 
neither in terms of asset pricing nor in terms of portfolio manageme nt. Measures of systematic 7 
 risk do not explain common stocks’ expected returns  well, and the popularity of active portfolio 
management represents a departure from the predicted passive buy-and-hold strategy . In con-
trast, theories of financial markets consi dering asymmetrically informed investors seem well 
supported by existing empirical studies. Measures of information risk put forward by this liter-
ature seem to perform well in explaining assets’ returns. For example, the “Probability of In-
formation -Based T rading” (PIN) introduced by Easley  et al. (2002), a measure of “private  in-
formation " based on a microstructure model, is statistically and economically significant in ex-
plaining U.S. common stock returns. The predictions of REE models are also supported in  terms 
of portfolio management (e. g., Biais  et al. , 2010 ).  
When investors are differently informed, analy zing the performance of mutual funds needs to 
be consider ed in  a more realistic setting than the traditional CAPM . Active mutual fund man-
agers spend time, expertise , and resources on acquiring and processing information. Their cli-
ents, who do not have the managers’ ability to process information, should be considered unin-
formed investors. Based on their expertise, fund managers should be able to make better port-
folio allocation decisions than uninformed investors. REE models predict that, at equilibrium, 
the extra  performance  obtained by mutual funds  just compensate s the informa tion-acquisition 
costs incurred .  
The partition of the investors' universe i n these two groups  (informed and uninformed investors) 
justifies why we  use REE models with asymmetrically informed investors , specifically  the GS 
model , for our research issue. Our objective is to mobilize the GS model to build a reference 
portfolio for a ssessing fund performance from the point of view of uninformed investors ex-
plicitl y6.  
1.2 THE SETTING  
GS consider only one risky asset. We use the multi -asset version of this model as proposed by 
Jimenez -Garcès  (2004), who presents  an exact multi -asset replic ation of the original GS model7. 
The model is static and considers two types of investors, informed and uninformed, who are 
                                                           
6 Other models consider that the information is dispersed across investors rather than detained by just 
one group of them (Hel lwig, 1980; Admati, 1985; Fontaine et al. , 2018).  Other theories rationalizing  
optimal portfolios that deviate from the market portfolio include those considering non -standard prefer-
ences, such as the prospect theory , or theories considering disappointment  aversion (e.g., Dahlquist  et 
al., 2016; Ang et al. , 2005).  
7 Kodres & Pritsker  (2002) also propose a multi -asset generalization of the GS model. Their model 
departs from GS by considering that noise comes from the presence of liquidity traders, not from s upply 
uncertainty.   8 
 rational (they maximize the utility of their fin al wealth conditionally on the available  infor-
mation set). Agents invest at 𝑡=0 and consume at 𝑡=1. There are 𝑛 risky securities and one 
risk-free asset. For simplicity, the risk -free rate of return is set equal to zero. The percentage of 
informed investors is denoted by 𝜆. The securities' payoff 𝑃̃1 at 𝑡=1 writes:  
𝑃̃1=𝜃̃+𝜀̃ (1) 
where 𝜃̃ is the payoff’s component known only by informed investors, designated "infor-
mation", and 𝜖̃ is the component unknown to all investors, designated "residual unce rtainty". 
The expected value of the residu al uncertainty equal s zero. The vectors 𝜃̃ and 𝜀̃ are jointly mul-
tivariate normal and independent, and their variance -covariance matrices are denoted by 𝑇 and 
𝑈, respectively8. The information set of the informed investor resides in the observation o f 𝜃̃ 
and that of the equilibrium price at 𝑡=0. The information set of the uninformed investor con-
sists only of the observation of the equilibrium price at 𝑡=0. 
As is common in REE models, per capita asset supply is a random vector 𝑧̃. This vector is 
independent of 𝜃̃ and 𝜀̃ and joins the normal distribution of the other variables in the model. 
The assumption that 𝑧̃  is unknown by investors is necessary for making equilibrium prices 
partially (not perfectly) revealing9. The variance -covariance m atrix of the supply is designated 
by 𝑍. Matrices 𝑈, 𝑇, and 𝑍 are regular, which is a necessary condition for ensuring the existence 
and the uniqueness of the equilibrium price. In addition, it is assumed that investors have con-
stant absolute risk avers ion, implying that their demand is independent of their initial wealth. 
The risk aversion coefficient 𝑎 is identical for all investors, 𝑎>0.  
Under the above conditions, following the same line of reasoning as in GS, there is a unique 
closed -form solutio n for the equilibrium price 𝑃̃0 (at 𝑡=0) within the class of linear functions 
of 𝜃̃ and 𝑧̃ of the form:   
𝑃̃0=𝐴0+𝐴1[𝜃̃−𝛼𝑈𝑧̃] (2) 
where 𝛼=𝑎/𝜆,   
𝐴0=(𝐼𝑛−𝐴1)𝐸(𝜃̃)+[𝛼𝐴1𝑈−𝑎𝑉𝑚]𝐸(𝑧̃) 
                                                           
8 Our theoretical framework comes with all the caveats associated with considering that asset prices are 
normally distributed, which in particular implies that they can be negative, and with considering constant 
absolute risk aversion. This may generate anomalies, already studied in Admati (1985).  
9 See the «  Grossman and Stiglitz paradox  » (Grossman , 1976)  for a discussion on this aspect.  9 
 𝐴1=(𝑇+𝑈−𝑉𝑚)𝑇−1 
𝑉𝑚=[𝜆𝑈−1+(1−𝜆)(𝑁+𝑈)−1]−1 
 𝑁=𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝜃̃|𝑃̃0)=(𝑇−1+𝛼−2𝑈−1𝑍−1𝑈−1)−1 
Matrix 𝑉𝑚 is the average variance -covariance matrix of assets' payoffs. The latter is the har-
monic mean of the informed and uninformed investors’ variance -covariance matrices, 
𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑃̃1|𝜃̃)=𝑈 and 𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑃̃1|𝑃̃0)=𝑁+𝑈, respectively.   
Eq. ( 2) shows that the equilibrium price 𝑃̃0 is a linear funct ion of two random variables: infor-
mation ( 𝜃̃) and supply ( 𝑧̃). Because supply is unknown, uninformed investors are unable to infer 
the realization of 𝜃̃ by observing asset s prices. Thus, some information remains private, gener-
ating informational asym metries between investors. The degree of information asymmetry is 
represented by matrix 𝑁=𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝜃̃|𝑃̃0). A higher variance  of information conditional  on prices 
means a higher degree of information asymmetry between informed and uninformed investor s.  
1.3 THE UNINFORMED INVEST OR’S ASSET PRICING MODEL  
Uninformed investor s maximize their utility conditional on  public information (i.e., the infor-
mation provided by equilibrium prices). The number of risky securities in their optimal portfo-
lio writes:  
𝑋̃𝑈𝐼=𝑎−1𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑈𝐼−1(𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0)×𝐸𝑈𝐼(𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0) (3) 
The subscript 𝑈𝐼 indicates that the variables are conditional on the information detained by 
uninformed investor s. After multiplying the left -hand side of this equation  by 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑈𝐼(𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0), 
it follows  
𝐸𝑈𝐼(𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0)=𝑎𝐶𝑜 𝑣𝑈𝐼(𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0;𝑃̃𝑜𝑝𝑡 ,𝑈𝐼1−𝑃̃𝑜𝑝𝑡 ,𝑈𝐼0) (4) 
where 𝑃̃𝑜𝑝𝑡 ,𝑈𝐼1 is the payoff of  uninformed investors ' optimal portfolio and 𝑃̃𝑜𝑝𝑡 ,𝑈𝐼0 is the current 
value of this portfolio. The expected return from these  investors ' perspective for a given asset 𝑖 
equals the covariance between the return of this asset and the return of their optimal portfolio.  
In Eq. ( 4), returns are expressed as price differences. A more familiar specification involves 
returns expressed as the ratio between price differences and beginning -of-period prices. After 
classical manipulations, we obtain the following asset -pricing model for an asset 𝑖 10 
 𝐸𝑈𝐼(𝑟̃𝑖)=𝛽𝑈𝐼,𝑖𝐸𝑈𝐼(𝑟̃𝑜𝑝𝑡 ,𝑈𝐼) (5) 
where  𝛽𝑈𝐼,𝑖=𝐶𝑜𝑣 𝑈𝐼(𝑟̃𝑖;𝑟̃𝑜𝑝𝑡 ,𝑈𝐼)/𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝑈𝐼(𝑟̃𝑜𝑝𝑡 ,𝑈𝐼) and 𝑟̃𝑜𝑝𝑡 ,𝑈𝐼 is the return of the uninformed in-
vestor’s optimal portfolio, which we have previously designated UIRP . From the perspective 
of these investor s, the expected return for an asset 𝑖 depends linearly on its beta relatively to 
UIRP  and the expected return of UIRP . It is important to emphasize th at the risk premium 
required by uninformed investor s to hold an asset ( particularly  a share of a mutual fund) is 
determined by UIRP , not by the market portfolio. As shown in Eq. (5), in a GS world, the alpha 
obtained by regressing (net of expenses) fund re turns on the returns of the price -contingent 
portfolio UIRP  has to be indistinguishable from zero. This important result justifies our paper’s 
approach to assessing the performance of mutual funds.  
Another aspect that deserves to be  mentioned is that , in the GS framework , the market portfolio 
performs better than  UIRP . The market portfolio is indeed the weighted average of two portfo-
lios, UIRP , and the optimal portfolio of informed investor s (which performs better than UIRP  
because these investor s have an informational advantage ), the weights being  the proportions of 
the two categories of investors on the market. It follows immediately that , in the GS world, the 
alpha obtained by regressing (net of expenses) fund returns on the market portfolio returns  
woul d be negative . Existing studies largely corroborate this prediction , as they  find negative 
market -risk-adjusted returns for actively managed mutual funds. Yet, this does not mean that 
the mutual fund is poorly managed; it just comes from the fact that  the reference portfolio  uti-
lized in assessing performance is not the correct one.  
1.4 THE UNINFORMED INVEST OR’S OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO  
We now analyze  the structure of the UIRP  price -contingent portfolio. To simplify the analysis, 
we focus on the unconditional expectat ion of the portfolio’s composition10. After some simple 
mathematical manipulations, it follows  
𝐸(𝑋̃𝑈𝐼)=(𝐼+𝜆𝑈−1𝑁)−1∗𝐸(𝑧̃) (6) 
The optimal portfolio’s composition depends on the degree of information asymmetr y between 
investors, assessed by the matrix 𝑁, the residual uncertainty, 𝑈, and the expected value of the 
                                                           
10 Considering conditional expectations makes it difficult to analyze asset prices and optimal portf olios. 
Furthermore, anomalies may arise, which have been studied extensively in the literature ( Admati , 1985; 
Jimenez -Garcès , 2004).  11 
 number of assets per capita , 𝐸(𝑧̃).  
Eq. ( 6) suggests that the number of securities in the price -contingent po rtfolio is negatively 
related to their degree of information asymmetry, as assessed by the matrix 𝑁. Nevertheless, 
the equation is difficult to interpret because the portfolio’s composition is expressed with  ma-
trices. One level of analysis is to consider that all model’s exogenous matrices ( 𝑇, 𝑈 and 𝑍) are 
diagonal, which means that securities are not correlated. In this case, Eq. ( 6) implies that the 
number of shares of asset i in the portfolio equals (1+𝜆𝑢𝑖−1𝑛𝑖)−1∗𝐸(𝑧̃𝑖), where 𝑢𝑖 is the 
residual variance of asset 𝑖 and 𝑛𝑖 is the variance of 𝜃̃𝑖 conditional on prices. It follows imme-
diately that a  higher information asymmetry for asset 𝑖 implies a lower weight for this stock in 
the uninformed investor’s optimal portfolio.  
Building on REE models, Burlacu  et al.  (2012) propose a measure that is positively correlated 
to the degree of information asymmetry of a stock. This measure, known as “ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)”, is 
the 𝑅2 from th e regression of stock returns on the beginning -of-period prices. “ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)” 
can be easily determined using only stock prices and proves to be relevant on both theoretical 
and empirical grounds as a measure of information asymmetry. Simulation anal yses performed 
by Jimenez -Garcès (2004), who uses the GS setting, and Burlacu  et al.  (2012), who use Ad-
mati’s (1985) setting, show that this measure captures information asymmetry effects. Stocks 
with high (low) information asymmetry levels have high (low)  𝑅2 and exhibit high (low) ex-
pected returns. This result is robust when considering various levels of correlation between 
assets’ information, residual uncertainty , or supply uncertainty. On empirical grounds, 
“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)” proves to be a statistic ally significant predictor of expected returns and is robust 
to size and book -to-market ratios, liquidities, and other measures of information asymmetry 
such as the probabilities of information -based trading11.   
                                                           
11 Biais  et al.  (2010) also propose a methodology that uses the information contained in prices to build  
the optimal portfol io from the perspective of uninformed investor s. The methodology extracts the infor-
mation contained in prices by projecting stock returns on prices for six portfolios constructed from a 
double sort of stocks based on the firm’s size and its book -to-market value. The expected returns and 
variance –covariance matrix from this projection allow constructing the optimal portfolio of the unin-
formed investor . This approach implicitly considers that  all stocks belonging to a given portfolio among 
the six portfolios  have the same level of information asymmetry because these portfolios are, by con-
struction, value -weighted . Our approach rather considers distinctly the level of information asymmetry 
for each individual stock, not for portfolios of stocks . For this reason , we believe that our approach 
allows constructing a reference portfolio  that is more adequate for assessing the performance of mutual 
funds . 
 12 
 We use “ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)” to construct UIRP . As Eq. ( 6) suggests, the weight of a stock in UIRP  
is negatively related to its level of information asymmetry. Therefore, 1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟𝑖)” for 
stock 𝑖 will be considered as the weight of this stock in UIRP . This weight can be considered 
as a measure of information precision; a higher precision (i.e., a lower degree of information 
asymmetry) implies a higher weight of the stock in the UIRP  price -contingent portfolio.  
1.5 SIMULATION ANALYSIS  
We now check that the portfolio built using this information asymmetry measure  behaves sim-
ilarly to the price -contingent portfolio based on the unobservable REE model parameters as in 
Eq. ( 6). The analysis cannot be performed analytically beca use of the complexities involved by 
matrix computations. Instead , we will use a simulation analysis. For a given stock 𝑖, 1−
“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)” represents the return variance conditional on prices divided by the total (uncon-
ditional) return variance:  
1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟𝑖)”=𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑃̃𝑖1−𝑃̃𝑖0|𝑃̃0)/𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑃̃𝑖1−𝑃̃𝑖0) (7) 
where 𝑃̃𝑖1−𝑃̃𝑖0 represents the return of stock 𝑖 expressed as a price difference. The numerator 
and the denomin ator in the right -hand side of Eq. ( 7) are the 𝑖-th terms on the main diagonal of 
matrices 𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0|𝑃̃0) and 𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0).  
By replacing the formula of the equilibrium price 𝑃̃0 from Eq. ( 2), we obtain:  
𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0|𝑃̃0)=𝑁 (8) 
𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑃̃1−𝑃̃0)=(𝐼−𝐴1)𝑇(𝐼−𝐴1)+𝛼2𝐴1𝑈𝑍𝑈 𝐴1+𝑈 (9) 
The terms of the right -hand side of Eq. ( 7) obtain from multiplying the matrices in Eq. ( 8) and 
Eq. ( 9) at the left and at the right by a vector in which ent ries are all equal to zero except the 𝑖-
th entry, which equals one.  
Our simulation analysis considers a market with two risky stocks 𝑖∈{1,2}. The goal is to com-
pare, for various levels of information asymmetry, the structure of the portfolio based on unob-
servable REE parameters, as given b y Eq. ( 6), and that of the portfolio assessed with observable 
variables. The latter uses 1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)” as a weight for each individual stock. We study 
how information asymmetry impacts the ratio of the two stock h oldings in the price -contingent 
portfolio determined with unobservable REE parameters, 𝐸(𝑋̃𝑈𝐼1)
𝐸(𝑋̃𝑈𝐼2), and the ratio of the two stock 13 
 holdings in the portfolio determined with observable variables, [1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟1)”]∗𝐸(𝑧̃1)
[1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟2)”]∗𝐸(𝑧̃2), where 
𝐸(𝑧̃𝑖) is the expected supply for stock 𝑖. On a perfect market, each investor optimally holds the 
market portfolio; the ratio of the two stocks equals 𝐸(𝑧̃1)
𝐸(𝑧̃2) for each investor. On a market with 
informational asymmetries, the uninformed investor is expected to hold less of the stock with a 
higher degree of information asymmetry. This aspect is confirmed by our simulation analysis  
hereafter .  
We consider a risk -aversion coeff icient 𝑎=0.1 and a proportion of informed (resp . unin-
formed) investors of 0.4 (resp . 0.6). These choices are arbitrary and have no fundamental con-
sequences on our results. The information uncertainty is modeled by the matrix 𝑇=(1 𝑡12
𝑡12 1) 
and the re sidual uncertainty is modeled by the matrix 𝑈=(1 𝑢12
𝑢12 1). The parameters 𝑡12 and 
𝑢12 vary across simulations. S tock s upply uncertainty is modeled by the matrix = (𝑧11 𝑧12
𝑧12 1).  
We vary the level of information asymmet ry on stock  1 by changing 𝑧11; the latter takes values 
from 1 to 10. A higher level of noise (supply uncertainty) for stock  1 implies a higher level of 
information asymmetry for this stock . The latter is assessed by 𝑛1=𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝜃̃1|𝑃̃0), and therefore 
we expect a lower weight of stock 1 in the price -contingent portfolio based on unobservable 
REE parameters and in the portfolio based on the observable variable 1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)”.  
 
Table  I shows the  results of our simulation analyses for four configurations. The first one con-
siders that stocks  are not correlated: 𝑡12=𝑢12=𝑧12=0. The other three configurations con-
sider a correlation coefficient of 0.5 for each one of the thre e parameters, with the other two 
correlation c oefficients being equal to zero . For 𝑧11=1, the level of information asymmetry is 
identical for the two stocks , and therefore their weight in the portfolio is the same.  
The table shows that, whatever the setting, an incr ease in noise implies an increase in the level 
of information asymmetry of stock  1 relative to stock  2, measured by 𝑛11
𝑛22, where 𝑛11 and 𝑛22 
are the diagonal terms of the matrix 𝑁. The table also shows that the ratio of the two stocks'  
weights in the price -contingent portfolio assessed with unobservable REE parameters and the 
one assessed with the observable variable 1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)” are coherent. The two ratios de-
crease in a similar way, confirming that a higher level of informati on asymmetry on stock 1 14 
 implies a lower holding of this stock  in the price -contingent portfolio, for both specifications.   
(Insert Table I about here)  
In unexposed analyses, we have performed various other simulations. In some of them, we have 
changed the  total level of information for asset 1, 𝑡11=𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝜃̃1), and have found  similar re-
sults. As 𝑡11 increases, the information asymmetry for stock  1 decreases relative to stock  2. The 
explanation is that the amount  of total information increases for a given level of noise, making 
the pri ce of stock 1 more informative than the price of stock  2. The proportion of stock  1 in the 
price -contingent portfolio increases, whatever the portfolio specification. Another set of unex-
posed simulations consist s in varying the level of residual uncertaint y for stock  1, 𝑢11=
𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝜖̃1), which is the first entry of the residual uncertainty matrix 𝑈. Again, we find similar 
results. Residual uncertainty affects all investors in the market. A high residual uncertainty “di-
lutes” the information asymmetry problem and , therefore , “aligns” the portfolios of all inves-
tors. The information asymmetry problem becomes less important  for uninformed investors, 
which results in a higher proportion of stock 1 holding s in their portfolio.  
Overall, we conclude that the observable v ariable 1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)” performs well in structur-
ing a portfolio that is close to the one held by uninformed investor s in the GS framework. In 
what follows, we describe the empirical methodology employed to build this portfolio.   
2 BUILDING UIRP :  EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY  
This section presents our empirical proxy for the degree of information asymmetry affecting a 
stock. We use this proxy to build our uninformed investor’s reference portfolio  UIRP . As this 
portfolio uses ex-post information  (assets' supply, which  is proxied by common stocks' capital-
ization), this portfolio is not investable. Indeed, an uninformed investor does not observe sup-
ply. However, th ese investors can use this portfolio  to assess  the performance of their shares of 
funds. The market portfoli o would be irrelevant f or this purpose .  
2.1 THE EMPIRICAL PROXY F OR THE DEGREE OF INF ORMATION ASYMMETRY  
We follow the theory and construct the reference portfolio  from an uninformed investor’s per-
spective by under - (over -) weighing common stocks with high (lo w) information asymmetry. 
We first estimate 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟), which is the coefficient of determination12 𝑅2 of the regression 
                                                           
12 In what follows, we will use interchangeably 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟) and 𝑅2. 15 
 of stock returns on prices. The regression 's specification is, as in Burlacu et al.  (2012),  
𝑟𝑖,𝑡=𝛼𝑖,0+𝛽𝑖,1𝑃𝑖,𝑡−1+∑𝛽𝑖𝑆𝐼𝐶𝑗𝑃𝑖,𝑡−1𝑆𝐼𝐶𝑗4
𝑗=1+𝜀𝑖,𝑡 (10) 
where 𝑟𝑖,𝑡 is the daily return of common stock i on day 𝑡, 𝑃𝑖,𝑡−1 is the closing (adjusted and 
normalized) price of stock 𝑖 on day 𝑡−1, 𝑃𝑖,𝑡−1𝑆𝐼𝐶𝑗 is the (adjusted and nor malized) price of in-
dustry portfolios  on day 𝑡−1,  and 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 is the error term.  
The empirical variables are determined exactly as in Burlacu et al.  (2012). The normalized price 
𝑃𝑖 of an individual stock 𝑖 is determined in two steps. First, the  price is set to one the first day 
the stock appears in the CRSP U.S. Daily Stock Database and then increased or decreased by 
the daily stock return, which is directly extracted from this database. Second, the price thus 
obtained is normalized , that is, we  divid e it by the price of the market index. We normalize 
prices to mitigate stationarity issues13. The price of the market index is set to one the first date 
it appears in the database in January 1967, and then it is increased or decreased by the daily 
return of the CRSP value -weighted index.  
The normalized prices of industry portfolios are obtain ed in the same way as for individual 
stocks. The normalized price of the four -digit industry portfolio, 𝑃𝑖,𝑡𝑆𝐼𝐶4, is calculated using 
stocks having the s ame four -digit standard industrial classification (SIC) as stock 𝑖 and excludes 
this stock. This exclusion avoids spurious correlation between variables. The p ortfolio price  is 
set to one the first day it appears in our data set and then increased or decr eased by the daily 
weighted -average portfolio's return. The price of industry portfolios represents the value of a 
buy-and-hold strategy consisting of investing one dollar at the beginning of the estimation pe-
riod. The dividends are  reinvested each period.  The price is then normalized , that is, we divide 
it by the (normalized) price of the stock market index. The normalized price of the second 
portfolio, 𝑃𝑖,𝑡𝑆𝐼𝐶3, is calculated using stocks having the same three -digit SIC code as stock 𝑖 but 
excludes all stocks having the same four -digit SIC code (which implies that stock 𝑖 is also 
excluded). The same procedure applies to the two-digit and one -digit industry po rtfolios. For 
                                                           
13 Biais  et al.  (2010) analyze statio narity issues for their regressions of stock returns on the prices of 
Fama & French (1993) size and B/M portfolios. By means of Monte -Carlo simulations, they show that 
these regressions are not affected by stationarity. In analyses not included here, we ha ve also investi-
gated stationarity issues for our regressions. Our tests of stationarity and co -integration corroborate the 
results found by Biais  et al.  (2010).  16 
 more information on the construction of these portfolios, the reader can refer to Burlacu  et al.  
(2012).  
The data cover the period from January 1967 to December 20 20. We estimate stocks' 𝑅2 as the 
fit from the regression shown in Eq. (10) for all American -listed ordinary common stock s, 
which CUSIP ends with 10 or 11. 𝑅2 is estimated each month 𝑚 for each individual common 
stock 𝑖 using past daily returns  and (adjusted and normalized) prices from months 𝑚−12 to 
𝑚−1. We eliminate observations with zero stock returns to mitigate problems related to non -
synchronous or "thin" trading14. With this restriction, we require a minimum of 60 daily returns 
for the computation of 𝑅2. We are thus able to calculate 𝑅2 for e ach stock and each month 
during the analysis period. 𝑅2 will be considered the degree of information asymmetry affecting 
the stock during that month.  
Based on our empirical design, we compute 𝑅2 for 24,596 ordinary common stocks on the 
period betw een January 1968  and December 2020 , with an average of 4,084 stocks per month. 
The mean 𝑅2, which gauges the mean level of information asymmetry in the market, equals 
6.42% , with a standard deviation of 4.93% . Its median value is 5.24% , and the intra -quartile 
range is [3.35% ,8.04% ].  
2.2 CONSTRUCTION OF UIRP  
Since 1−𝑅2 is inversely correlated to the degree of information asymmetry as measured by 
𝑛𝑖, it will be used to quantify the weight of stock 𝑖 in UIRP . The return of this portfolio is a 
modif ied version of the market portfolio in which the weight of a given common stock is related 
to its capitalization and its degree of informational asymmetry, as indicated by the theory:  
𝑟𝑈𝐼𝑅𝑃 =∑ (1−𝑅𝑖2)𝐾𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1
∑ (1−𝑅𝑖2)𝐾𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1(11) 
In this equation, 𝑟𝑈𝐼𝑅𝑃 represents the return of the uninformed investor’s reference portfolio , 𝐾𝑖 
is the capitalization of common stock 𝑖, and 𝑅𝑖2 obtains from the regression of stock 𝑖‘s returns 
on prices as explai ned in the previous subsection.  
It is important to note that UIRP  is not investable from the perspective of uninformed investors  
                                                           
14 We check t he influence of non -synchronous trading by restricting our analysis to securities having 10 
minimum trading days per month or by eliminating stocks with prices lower than $1. Imposing this 
restriction does not change qualitatively our conclusions.   17 
 because it uses ex-post information . The weights used in equation (11) are indeed based on the 
mark et capitalization of common stocks. In the GS framework, uninformed investors do not 
observe market supply and , therefore , cannot construct this portfolio on an ex-ante basis. How-
ever, as affirmed previously, our objective is not to build an investable por tfolio for uninformed 
investors. Instead , we aim  to construct a reference portfolio allowing these investors to check 
ex-post that the return generated by an actively managed equit y mutual funds portfolio is suf fi-
cient to compensate for the risk as perceiv ed by uninformed investors . Ex-post, these investors 
obtain the information on market supply and are therefore able to construct this portfolio by 
following the methodology de scribed in this paper. Of course, this portfolio is more difficult to 
build  than the market portfolio, as it uses weights based on the stock's capitalization and its 
degree of informational  asymmetry. However, UIRP  is more  relevant to consider as a reference 
portfolio  because it is closer to the uninformed investor's optimal portfolio as predicted  by the 
theory . The market port folio is irrelevant as a reference portfolio  in the presence of asymmetry 
information.          
Overall, UIRP  is constructed using the universe of stocks belonging to the CRSP value -
weighted stock index but they ar e weighted differently in comparison to the CRSP index. How-
ever, the lack of sufficient data implies that we are not able to compute the  𝑅2 for all NYSE, 
AMEX , and NASDAQ -listed common stocks. We , therefore,  construct UIRP  in the following 
way. First, we build  the portfolio as in Eq. (11) with NYSE, AMEX , and NASDAQ -listed com-
mon stocks for which 𝑅2 can be determined. Then, we form a capitalization -averaged portfolio 
of the remaining common stocks listed on these markets, for which the data is not s ufficient to 
determine 𝑅2. UIRP  is the weighted average of the two portfolios, the weights being their cap-
italizations. Our results do not fundamentally change if we consider the portfolio containing 
only stocks with available 𝑅2. The stocks for wh ich we are not able to determine the 𝑅2 concern 
small firms, which  weigh little in comparison to other stocks.   
To assess the deviation between  UIRP  and the CRSP stock market index, we calculate the dif-
ference between the amount invested in the market index and the amount invested in UIRP , 
∑ 𝐾𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1 −∑ (1−𝑅𝑖2)𝐾𝑖=𝑛
𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑅𝑖2𝐾𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1, and then we express it as a percentage of the total 
market capitali zation, ∑ 𝑅𝑖2𝐾𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1/∑ 𝐾𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1. This variable, whi ch represents the value -weighted 
𝑅2 on the market , has a mean of 5.25%  over the entire sample period, with a median of 5.65%  
and an interquartile range of [3.68,6.20]. Unexposed analyses show  a diminishing trend  of this 
measure , with values between 5% and 7% during the first years of the sample, and between 18 
 3% and 4% during the last years.    
Table II  provides descriptive statistics for the returns of UIRP , the market index  assessed by 
the CRSP value -weighted index, and the Fama -French factor -mimicking portfolios. The latter 
are the “Small Minus Big” capitalization stocks (SMB), “High Minus Low” Book -to-Market 
stocks (HML), and “Momentum” (UMD for “Up Minus Down” previous returns) portfolios. 
The returns of these portfolios are extracted from the Kenneth  French website15. Table II  also 
presents the Pearson correlation coefficients between the returns of these portfolios.  
(Insert Table II about here)  
The average annualized return of UIRP  on the sample period is 11.05% , which is lower than 
the average retur n of the market index, 11.80% . The standard deviation of UIRP , 18.28% , is 
higher than that of the market’s index16, 15.81% . UIRP  exhibits a strong correlation with the 
market index, 0.977.   
3 MUTUAL FUND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  
This section starts by describing  our mutual fund sample and proceeds to analyze  mutual fund 
performance for both actively and passively managed equity mutual funds. It is important to 
recall that, a s our analysis considers a framew ork with informational asymmetries between in-
vestors, the  market portfolio is irrelevant as a reference portfolio for measuring fund perfor-
mance.  
3.1 DATA 
We collect data for U.S. equity mutual funds from the CRSP Survivor -Bias-Free Mutual Fund 
Database. The analysis period is from January 1968 to December 2020 , and our sample con-
struction  follows the same guidelines as in previous related empirical studies. We choose mu-
tual funds that invest in domestic  U. S. equities.  
CRSP provides information on mutual funds’ investment objective s from several sources: the 
                                                           
15 http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html .  
16 The fact that the portfolio of uninformed investors is riskier than the market portfolio is quite natural. 
Informed investors tilt their portfolio toward securities with higher private information content. Because 
of the informational advantage, the risk of the portfolio held by informed investors is, ceteris paribus , 
lower than the risk of the portfolio held by uninformed investors. The market portfolio is the average of 
these t wo portfolios. It follows that the portfolio of uninformed investors is, ceteris paribus , riskier than 
the market portfolio.  19 
 CRSP “Strategic Insight Objective”, which covers the period between 1993 and 1998 ; Wiesen-
berger, which covers the period from 1962 to 1993 ; and Lipper, which starts in 1998. The cor-
responding codes are synthesized by the CRSP “Style Code”, which covers the enti re database 
period and, therefore, will be used to construct our mutual fund sample. The CRSP mutual fund 
database guide provides a table of correspondence between the CRSP style code and the three 
funds’ investment objective s mentioned above .  
Our investi gations show that the CRSP style code is missing from some observations . At the 
same time,  the fund’s investment objective is still available at the same period in at least one of 
the other three classifications. We fill the missing data for such observati ons with the corre-
sponding available code in the three other classifications . Moreover, suppose an investment 
objective code is available for a given fund during year 𝑦−1 but not during year 𝑦. In that case, en 
we replace the missing data during year 𝑦 with the data available during year 𝑦−1. This pro-
cedure is standard  in existing empirical studies (e. g., Amihud & Goyenko , 2003).  
The sample comprises funds for which the first level in the CRSP style classification is “Equity” 
(the corresponding letter i n the database is “E”), with the second level being “Domestic” (t he 
corresponding letter in the database is “D”). Domestic equity mutual funds are thus determined 
by the first two letters, “ED”, of the CRSP style classification. At the third level, we reta in three 
categories as follows: “Sector” (S), “Cap -based” (C) , and “Style” (Y). At the fo urth level, we 
choose the sub -categories “Large Cap” (L), “Mid Cap” (M) , and “Small Cap” (S) within the 
“Cap -based” category, and the sub -categories “Growth” (G), “Gro wth & Income” (B) and “In-
come” (I) within the “Style” category. These categories contain a relatively similar number of 
funds. We exclude all other funds such as “foreign”, “bond”, “corporate” or “government” 
funds because they generally invest in minimal quantities of domestic U. S. equities. We ex-
clude passively managed funds identified in the CRSP database by an index fund flag. We 
analy ze these funds separately in our paper.  
By applying all these restrictions, our final sample comprises 26,407 distinct  actively managed 
U.S. domestic equity mutual funds that existed sometime during the 53 years  from January 
1968  to December  2020 . Table III presents descriptive statistics for our sample funds.  
(Insert Table III about here)  
The majority of our sample funds are open -end funds. The average Total Net Assets (TNA) is 
395 .29 M$, the average expense ratio (expressed as the percentage of total net assets per year) 20 
 is 1.32% , and th e average turnover ratio is 89.79% per year.  
(Insert Figure I about here)  
Figure I shows the value of one euro invested in UIRP , the CRSP value -weighted stock market 
index, an equ ally weighted portfolio of all sample  funds , and a TNA -weighted portfolio of these 
funds, together with the SMB, HML , and UMD factor -mimicking portfolios. The two portfolios 
of mutual funds have  a similar pattern to UIRP .  
3.2 MUTUAL FUND PERFORMANCE  
We measur e fund performance by the alpha, the risk -adjusted return from the classical model 
proposed by Jensen  (1968). This one -factor model traditionally considers  the stock market in-
dex as the reference portfolio . According to the theory, we use our UIRP  portfoli o as a reference 
portfolio . We also employ performance models including factor -mimicking portfolios as pro-
posed by Fama & French  (1993) and Carhart  (1997): SMB (small minus big size stocks) ; HML 
(high minus low book -to-market ratio stocks) ; and UMD (winner  minus loser stocks). The gen-
eral performance model specification is  
𝑟𝑝𝑡−𝑟𝑓𝑡=𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎+∑βj∗𝑟𝑗,𝑡+𝜖𝑡𝑛
𝑗=1(12) 
where 𝑟𝑝𝑡 is the monthly net return of the portfolio of mutual funds over month t, 𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 is the 
regression’s intercept, 𝑟𝑓𝑡 is the risk -free rate of return,  𝑟𝑗,𝑡 is the return of the reference portfolio  
𝑗 considered in the regression, 𝑛 is the number of reference portfolio s used, and 𝜖𝑡 is the error 
term. In the p articular case of the market portfolio, the return considered in this equation is in 
excess of the risk -free rate.  
In what follows, we use Jensen’s one -factor specification with the stock market index as a ref-
erence portfolio , and alternatively with UIRP , and Carhart’s specification with the stock market 
index and alternatively with UIRP  as reference portfolios . We estimate these regressions using 
OLS.  
3.2.1 Overall performance  
Rather than studying individual mutual funds, w e focus on TNA -weighted portfolios of  all sam-
ple funds. For a given month of a given year, the weight of a fund in the portfolio is the mutual 
fund’s TNA as of the previous month. This procedure, standard  in the existing literature, avoids 21 
 eliminating mutual funds that do not survive during t he sample period, for which there is insuf-
ficient data to determine their performance, thereby  mitigating survivorship biases.  
(Insert Table IV about here)  
Table IV presen ts the alpha of the TNA -weighted portfolio of all mutual funds in the sample 
and the corresponding factor loadings (betas). With the one -factor model considering UIRP as 
the reference portfolio , mutual funds exhibit a positive but insignificant alpha of 0.23%  per 
annum. The beta of the UIRP  portfolio is 0.84. The portfolio of mutual funds displays  a positive 
and insignificant alpha if the performance model includes the other  factor -mimicking portfo-
lios.  
The results change dramatically if the stock market i ndex is used as a reference portfolio . The 
one-factor model specification of Jensen (1968) shows a negative and highly significant alpha 
of -1.28%. With model specifications including factor -mimicking portfolios, alphas range be-
tween [−1.31% ,−0.99% ]. Thes e results are in line with those found in the previous empirical  
literature17 and show that, collectively, actively managed equity mutual funds underperform the 
market.  
To conclude, if the performance model uses the appropriate reference portfolio , UIRP , then the 
average mutual fund's performance  is positive and insignificant. The average mutual fund is 
negative and significant if the stock market index is used instead . 
3.2.2 Analysis of different categories of funds  
The degree of private information of the asset s held by funds may vary with the fund’s invest-
ment objective. For example, investing in small -capitalization stocks requires stronger expertise 
than for large -capitali zation stocks because small firms are less well-known by the market. Ta-
ble III shows that the average expense ratio for small -cap funds (1.45%) is higher than for large -
cap funds (0.71%). According to the theory, the performance of the assets held by funds with 
stronger expertise is higher than for ot her funds, but the extra  performance is compensated by 
                                                           
17 For comparison with existing results, Wermers (2000) studies a sample of 1,788 actively managed 
equity mutual funds on the period  between 1975  and 1994 . The sample’s alpha estimated with the 
Carhart’s performance model is −1.16%  per annum for the TNA -weighted portfolio of funds, and 
−1.15%  for the equally weighted portfolio of funds, both significant at the 1% level. Kacperczyk et a l. 
(2005) use a sample of 1,771 U.S. equity mutual funds on the period between 1984  and 1999 . The 
Carhart’s net alpha is a non -significant −0.07%  per quarter for the equally weighted portfolio of sample 
mutual funds.  22 
 the additional information acquisition costs  incurred by the fund . It follows that the funds' alpha 
net of expenses should be indistinguishable from zero for all catego ries of funds, irrespective 
of their investment objective.  
Table V presents the alpha of portfolios of funds by investment objective. The alphas based on 
UIRP  are either insignificant or positive and weakly  significant for all categories of funds . This 
result is in line with the theory. On the contrary, the alphas obtained with the stock market index  
(which is commonly used as a benchmark in the previous literature)  are either insignificant or 
significantly negative. The market -based alpha is nega tive and significant for the categories 
Growth, Sector , and “Other”. The r esults obtained with Carhart’s model specification a re rela-
tively similar , whether one uses UIRP  or the stock market index as a reference portfolio .  
(Insert Table V about here)  
Other characteristics that are known to be related to performance are fund expenses, turnover , 
and size. A puzzling fact about actively managed equity mutual funds resides in the strong 
negative relationship between pe rformance and expenses. Gil-Bazo & Ruiz -VerdÚ ( 2009) ex-
plain this result by strategic fee setting when investors have different degrees of sensitivity to 
performance. According to our previous discussion, performance and expenses should be pos-
itively relat ed if the performance is assessed with gross returns. A higher informational ad-
vantage requires higher information acquisition costs and generates higher performance. After 
subtracting expenses, the relationship between performance and expenses is expected  to vanish .  
(Insert Table VI about here)  
Table VI, Panel A, presents the alpha of portfolios of funds by deciles of expense ratio. We 
rank mutual funds every month in ten groups based on their expense ratio during that month18. 
Then, we form TNA -value -weighted portfolios for each rank of expense ratio. We then calcu-
late the alpha of these ten portfolios with several performance model specifications.  
If we consider UIRP  as a reference portfolio , the results show that mutual funds belonging to 
low- and medium -expense deciles exhibit either non -significant or significant ly positive alphas. 
The portfolios corresponding to high -expense deciles exhibit a negative and significant a lpha, 
especially for deciles 9 and 10. With the market -based portfolio, the alpha is negative for every 
expense decile and significant for all deciles except decile 1 and decile 2. The r esults obtained 
                                                           
18 In some cases, expense ratios are mis sing. In that case, as is common in the literature, we replace the 
missing observation by the last available expense ratio, if any, for each mutual fund.  23 
 with the four -factor model specifications  are similar . Overall, the results are similar to the pre-
vious literature, which shows that funds charging higher expenses tend to have lower perfor-
mance  if the latter is assessed using the stock market index as a reference portfolio . These re-
sults hold even if perform ance is assessed with UIRP .  
Turnover is another variable that is widely considered in studies of mutual fund performance, 
but there is no consensus in the literature about its impact on fund performance. This variable 
is likely to be related to performanc e because it determines operating costs and can indicate  of 
informational advantages. Grinblatt & Titman  (1994) find a positive relationship between fund 
performance and turnover and argue that this result is explained by the fact that fund managers 
trade more if they have more informational advantages. On the contrary, Amihud & Goyenko  
(2013) find that greater selectivity , indicative of superior informational advantages , is not as-
sociated with more frequent trading.  
Table VI, Panel B, replicates the analysis by category of fund turnover. The procedure adopted 
for classifying mutual funds is the same as the one used for expenses. We rank mutual funds 
every month in ten groups based on their turnover ratio during tha t month. Then, we form TNA -
value -weighted portfolios for each rank of turnover ratio and calculate the alpha of each of these 
ten portfolios with the same  performance model specifications. The results show that the UIRP -
adjusted alpha is insignificant for every category of fund turnover. Higher trading in mutual 
fund assets does not seem to be associated with higher performance. If the market portfolio  is 
used instead, all categories of funds exhibit a negative alpha, which is significant for all deciles 
except deciles 1 and 9. Results are relatively similar by using four -factor specifications. Fur-
thermore, t here is no discernible pattern in the link between turnover and performance; this 
result is consistent with the existing literature.  
The fund’s size (TN A) is another well -known determinant  of fund performance . The existing 
evidence shows , in general , that performance deteriorates if the fund becomes larger (disecon-
omies of scale) or older (e. g., Pástor  et al. , 2015). Table VI, Panel C, presents fund alpha for 
deciles of fund total net assets built in the same way as for expenses and turnover. We rank 
mutual funds monthly  in ten groups based on their TNA  as of the previous month . Then, we 
form TNA -value -weighted po rtfolios for each TNA  rank and calculate the alpha of each of 
these ten portfolios with the same  performance model specifications. Irrespective of the funds’ 
TNA category, the UIRP -adjusted alpha is insignificant for all portfolios, whether one uses the 
one- or four -factor specification. If the reference portfolio  is the stock market index, then the 24 
 alpha is negative and significant for most TNA deciles and performance model specifications. 
The negative and significant alphas obtained systematically with th e market portfolio as the 
reference portfolio suggest that this p ortfolio is not efficient.  
3.2.3 Performance and degree of active management (selectivity)  
Using a relevant reference portfolio  is not only important to assess overall fund performance; 
it is also  crucial  for studying the link between performance and the fund’s degree of active 
management. The degree of active management is sometimes referred to as “selectivity”. 
Stronger active management generates higher informational advantages and is indicative  of in-
vestments in stocks with high er degrees of informational asymmetries. A higher selectivity 
moves the manager’s optimal portfolio  away from the market portfolio to a great er extent. Sym-
metrically, the reference portfolio  of the uninformed investor wil l also deviate more from the 
market portfolio. It follows that the irrelevancy of the market portfolio as a reference portfolio  
for measuring performance increases  as the fund’s degree of active management is stronger.  
The literature assesses the degree o f active management for mutual funds in various ways.  
Kacperczyk  et al.  (2005) and Burlacu  et al.  (2006) consider the  level of concentration of ac-
tively managed equity mutual fund portfolios in economic sectors and find th at it is positively 
and significa ntly related to the fund's performance. Wermers  (2003) use s the tracking error 
variance to measure  fund selectivity and finds similar results. Cremers & Petajisto  (2009) de-
termine fund selectivity by the “active share”, which measures the deviation of the mutual fund 
portfolios’ weights from those of the market portfolio. Amihud & Goyenko  (2013) measure 
fund selectivity by the fund’s 𝑅2 obtained with a  multifactor model. The consensus in the em-
pirical literature in the field is that funds that are more actively managed perform better .  
We determine a fund’s degree of active management with the mutual fund’s 𝑅2, a measure 
propose d by Amihud & Goyenko  (2013). Th is measure is simple to calculate and obtains from 
a regression of fund return s on the returns of the stock market index and factor -mimicking 
portfolios. A higher 𝑅2 indicates a stronger link with factor portfolios and h ence is associated 
with lower selectivity (the fund tracks reference portfolios more closely).  
We calculate 𝑅2 for every fund with sufficient return data in our sample. (This 𝑅2 is not to be 
confounded with the one we use for constructing UIRP .) Specifically, we decompose each 
fund's entire period of available data  into three -year nonoverlapping periods . Then, we calculate 
a given fund’s 𝑅2 by projecting its returns on the corresponding factors for each period. We 25 
 retain only funds and periods with a minimum number of 30 available monthly returns per 
period  (among the 36 maximum monthly returns) . 𝑅2 represents the degree of fund active man-
agement during that period; the measure is updated each period for each fund.  
As in Amihud & Goyenko  (2013), we use two model specifications  for determining 𝑅2: a one -
factor specification based on the stock market index and Carhart’s four -factor specification. 
This procedure allows determining the 𝑅2 for 20,526 mutual funds in our sample. With the 
classical CAPM specification, the mean 𝑅2 is 0.78 with a median of 0.85 and an intra -quartile 
range of [0.72,0.92]. With Carhart's specification, the mean 𝑅2 is 0.86 with a median of 0.92 
and an intra -quartile range of [0.85,0.96]. 
In a second ste p, we rank 𝑅2 in 10 deciles each month during the sample period , and then we 
build, for each decile, value -weighted portfolios of all mutual funds with available 𝑅2. This 
generates 𝑡𝑒𝑛 portfolios of funds, ran king from the one that is the most "selective" (low 𝑅2) to 
the one that is the most "diversified " (high 𝑅2). The alpha of each portfolio is estimated on the 
entire period from 1968 to 2020 with the model specifications that are considered throughout 
our study. Table VII presents the alpha for each 𝑅2 decile and each performance model.  
(Insert Table VII about here)  
Alpha is positive and insignificant for all UIRP -based (one - and four -factor)  model sp ecifica-
tions and most deciles , except for decile 6 with the one -factor specification. The alpha deter-
mined with model specifications that consider the market index as a reference portfolio  is neg-
ative and significant in most cases. It is also noteworthy th at mutual funds situated in deciles 1 
and 2 display  relatively higher alphas. As in previous studies, greater selectivity seems to gen-
erate higher alphas for funds with very high levels of speciali zation.  
3.3 THE CASE OF INDEX MUT UAL FUNDS  
We also separately analyze the case of U.S. domestic equity index mutual funds, which gener-
ally are considered  “passively ” managed  portfolios . The investment objective of such funds is 
to track the market portfolio or specific market segments. Previous empirical studies excl ude 
these types of funds from their performance analyses  or use them as reference portfolio s.  
In the REE models’ framework, tracking the market portfolio is not a passive type of manage-
ment because it requires obtaining informational advantages. The marke t portfolio is not acces-
sible to uninformed investors because it is unobservable. This portfolio is rather accessible to a 26 
 representative investor possessing an “average” type of information, that is, which  beliefs rep-
resent the weighted -average beliefs of  all investors on the market ( e.g., Biais  et al. , 2010). This 
average type of information obtains  at a cost. It follows that, as for actively managed equity 
mutual funds, the performance of “index” funds has to be judged in relationship with the refer-
ence portfolio  from the perspective of the uninformed investor, not that of the index that man-
agers track.  
The CRSP mutual fund database classifies index funds in to three categories. The first one com-
prises “index -based funds ” (index flag = “B”),  and utilize s indexes as “the primary filter for the 
purchase and sale of securities”. The second one comprises “pure index funds ” (index flag =  
”D”), which  objective is to “match the total investment performance of a publicly recognized 
securities market index”. The thi rd category comprises “enhanced” index funds , (index flag =  
”E”), which objective is to “exceed the total investment performa nce of a publicly recognized 
securities market”.  
We replicate some of our analyses for 3,286 index funds identified by the CRSP sur vivorship -
free mutual fund database. We build the sample  of index funds by respecting the same criteria 
as for actively managed equity funds in our sample. Overall, index funds exhibit an expense 
ratio of 0.86%, a turnover ratio of 116% , and an average TNA  of 1,164 M$. These figures 
suggest a high activity level , but this activity is mainly due to the presence of “enhanced” index 
funds. If the analysis is restricted only to “pure” index funds, the expense ratio equals  0.59%, 
the turnover ratio equals 60% , and the average TNA equals 2,012 M$.   
As for actively managed funds, we find that the TNA -weighted portfolio of index  funds ex hibits 
an insignificant alpha of −9 basis points per year ( t-value of −0.12) with the one -factor model 
based on our UIRP  portfolio. With the four -factor model considering UIRP  and factor -mimick-
ing portfolios, we find a positive and insignificant alpha of 9 basis points per year ( t-value o f 
0.14). Using the stock market index as a reference portfolio  in the one -factor model, the alpha 
becomes negative and significant, with a value of −145 basis points per year ( t-value of 
−2.57). The alpha from the Carhart’s (1995) model is negative, −113 basis points per year, 
and significant ( t-value of −2.17).  
The previous literature suggests that investors should buy index funds because they perform 
better  than actively managed funds . Our results show that if the performance is measured using 
the approp riate reference portfolio , UIRP , uninformed investors would be indifferent between 27 
 index funds and actively managed funds because the alpha is insignificant for both categories. 
The negative and significant performance obtained by using the market portfoli o as the refer-
ence portfolio indicates that this portfolio is not the correct benchmark.  
3.4 ROBUSTNESS CHECKS  
In unexposed analyses, we have checked the robustness of our results to various alternative 
model specifications and found similar results. These an alyses are available at request. First, 
we have estimat ed each individual fund’s alpha on the entire period of data availability  with the 
various performance model specifications used in this article rather than constructing a portfolio 
of all sample mutua l funds. Then, we have averaged these alphas across mutual funds using 
TNA -based weights (and equal weights ) to analyze fund performance. Our results do not 
change fundamentally . However, in many cases, we find positive and significant alphas using 
UIRP . Overall, these results provide a more optimistic picture of mutual fund active manage-
ment. The problem with this empirical approach  used in some existing studies  is that it may 
generate a survivorship bias . Indeed, this analysis implicitly consider s only funds with suffi-
cient data to estimate performance  accurately . Most funds  with enough  data are funds that sur-
vive and are known to exhibit higher performance. Because this type of analysis implicitly 
considers funds that perform better, the alphas are impr oved, which is what we observe empir-
ically.   
We have also replicated our analyses using equally -weighted portfolios rather than TNA -
weighted ones. Again, our results do not change fundamentally . Still,  they show a more opti-
mistic picture of active mutual fun d management in that the alphas calculated with UIRP  are 
higher  than those calculated with the methodology used in the paper . The better results obtained 
with equally weighted portfolios may be explained by the fact that this methodology gives more 
importa nce to small -TNA funds, which tend to exhibit higher performance, as suggested  by our 
results in Table VI (diseconomies of scale). We also find that the alpha adjusted for market risk 
is negative and significant wi th most performance model specification s and for most categories 
of funds.  
CONCLUSION  
Our paper proposes a new approach for assess ing the performance of actively managed equity 
mutual funds. While the related literature stresses some doubt about the exper tise of the funds’ 
managers and their ability to create value for their clients, one can  still observe a high demand 28 
 of individual investors for such investment vehicles. The objective of this paper is to bring an 
explanation for this  by mobilizing the the ory of portfolio choice under asymmetric information. 
Active management is justified by the existence of informational asymmetries between mutual 
fund managers (considered informed investors) and their clients (considered uninformed inves-
tors). When invest ors do not share homogeneous information about the future payoff of risky 
assets, the traditional CAPM does not hold anymore. The theory of rational expectation equi-
librium models (in particular , the GS model) teaches us that when there are informed and un in-
formed investors on the market, none of them hold the traditional market portfolio . Still,  both 
must consider a portfolio depending on their corresponding available information set.  
In this paper, we build on this literature and propose a new reference portfolio , as an alternative 
to the traditional market portfolio, for assessing mutual fund performance from their clients’ 
perspective , considered uninformed investors . Based on the GS model, we first show that the 
uninformed investor’s reference portfoli o tilts towards stocks with low levels of information 
asymmetry (high levels of information precision). The first contribution of this paper is to pro-
pose a theoretical approach to build ing the uninformed investor 's (i.e., the mutual funds’ client) 
referen ce portfolio . Then we mobilize  this approach to construct this portfolio  empirically. To 
achieve  this goal, we use the “Proxy E(R)” measure of Burlacu et al. (2002) and compute its 
value for each stock and each month of our sample period. The second contri bution is to em-
pirically analyze  the performance of actively managed U.S. domestic equity mutual funds by 
using the uninformed investor’s reference portfolio  in Jensen 's (1968) and Carhart 's (1997) per-
formance model specifications. Following GS, the alpha,  computed with returns net of ex-
penses, should be insigni ficantly different from zero from the perspective of the uninformed 
investor on an informationally efficient market , as expenses exactly compensate for the infor-
mation acquisition costs. We precisely  obtain these results.  
By using the correct reference portfolio  from the uninformed investor’s perspective ( UIRP ), we 
rehabilitate to some extent the value of active management: managers of equity mutual funds 
seem to provide non -negative UIRP -adjusted alp has to their clients. This may explain why un-
informed economic agents continue to use mutual funds service s and why investment in mutual 
funds is so important, despite the pessimistic results obtained by a body of the existing empirical 
literature. To some  extent, our results are in line with those obtained by Wermers  (2000): fund 
managers perform well enough to compensate for expenses and transaction costs.  
This study may open some new avenues for research. The literature offers several  measures for 29 
 asses sing the degree of information asymmetry between investors in the market. Such measures 
may prove fruitful in constructing  the uninformed investor’s reference portfolio  in alternative 
ways to that offered in our paper. The UIRP -based performance approach m ay also provide 
answers to the challenging debate on “l uck versus skill” in cross -sectional studies of mutual 
fund performance. Fama & French  (2010) put forward the “arithmetic of active management” 
(Sharpe , 1991), according to which active management is a  zero-sum game. They find that few 
actively managed funds produce risk -adjusted returns that cover their costs. However, the re-
sults obtained by the existing literature are far from offering a consensus on this debate (e.g., 
Kosowski  et al. , 2006).  
Resear ch on the persistence of mutual fund performance, which does not offer a consensus, 
could also benefit from using  the correct reference portfolio . The seminal study of Carhart 
(1997) shows that common factors almost completely explain persistence  in stock returns. Sim-
ilarly, Fama & French  (2010) and Berk & van Binsbergen  (2015) find little evidence of persis-
tence in actively managed equity mutual funds. However, Grinblatt & Titman  (1992) find that 
differences in performance between funds persist over time a nd argue that this persistence 
shows the ability of fund managers to generate abnormal returns. More recent studies corrobo-
rate this result at the international level (e. g., Ferreira  et al. , 2019). All these studies have in 
common that they use the stock market index, among others, as the reference portfolio . We 
believe that the UIRP -based approach may provide additional insights into these issues . Exist-
ing studies suggest that fund performance is highly  sensitive to reference portfolio  specifica-
tions (Grinblatt & Titman , 1994).   30

Table I 
Simulation Analysis  
This table considers a GS setting with two risky assets. It presents the relationship between noise (supply uncer-
tainty 𝑧11 for stock 1) and three related variables: the relative degree of information asymmetry for asset 1, the 
relative weight of asset 1 in the price -contingent portfolio assessed with unobservable REE parameters, and the 
relative weight of asset 1 in the  price -contingent portfolio assessed with the observable variable 1−
“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)”. The degree of information asymmetry of asset 1 relative to that of asset 2 is measured by 𝑛11
𝑛22, where 
𝑛11 and 𝑛22 are the diagonal terms of the ma trix 𝑁. The row heading for this variable is “Information Asymmetry”. 
The weight of asset 1 relative to asset 2 in the price -contingent portfolio with unobservable REE parameters is 
measured by 𝐸(𝑋̃𝑈𝐼1)
𝐸(𝑋̃𝑈𝐼2), where 𝐸(𝑋̃𝑈𝐼1) and 𝐸(𝑋̃𝑈𝐼2) are the number of assets in the portfolio as given by Eq. ( 6). The 
corresponding row heading for this variable is “Asset Weight in Portfolio 1”. The relative weight of asset 1 in the 
price -continge nt portfolio based on the observable variable 1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)” is  [1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟1)”]∗𝐸(𝑧̃1)
[1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟2)”]∗𝐸(𝑧̃2), where 
𝐸(𝑧̃𝑖) is the expected supply for asset 𝑖, and 1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟𝑖)” is the vari able 1−“𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑦  𝐸(𝑟)" determined for 
asset 𝑖. The corresponding row heading for this variable is “Asset weight in portfolio 2”. In all simulations, the 
proportion of informed investors is 40% , and the risk -aversion coefficient is 0.1.

 Table III 
Summary Statistics for Mutual Funds  
This table presents fund characteristics for 26,407 U.S. actively managed equity mutual funds on the perio d from January 1968 to December 2020. “TNA” (Total Net Assets) 
is the closing market value of securities owned, plus all assets minus all liabilities. “Turnover” (over the calendar year) i s the minimum of aggregate purchases of securities or 
aggregate sale s of securities divided by the average TNA of the fund. “Expenses” (over the calendar year) designates the percentage of the total investment shareholders pay for 
the mutual fund’s operating expenses. Net fund returns are calculated as follows. Each month of each year, we compute the TNA -weighted mean of net returns for all sample 
funds, where the weights are the TNA at the end of the previous month. Then we average returns across time during the whole p eriod with equal weights. "NA" means that the 
informat ion is not available in the database.

 Table IV 
Performance models' estimates  
This table presents coefficient estimates of the regression of monthly returns of the v alue-weighted portfolio of 
mutual funds on the returns of reference  portfolios on the period between January 1968 and December 2020. The 
portfolio of funds comprises 26,407 U.S. domestic actively managed equity funds that existed sometime during 
this perio d. The set of reference portfolio s comprises UIRP , the CRSP value -weighted index considered as the 
proxy for the market portfolio, the SMB (for "Small Minus Big" capitalization stocks), "HML" (for "High Minus 
Low" book -to-market stocks), and “UMD” (for "Up  Minus Down" prior stock returns) factor -mimicking portfo-
lios. Alpha is estimated using various portfolios  in combination. The general performance model specification is  
𝑟𝑝𝑡−𝑟𝑓𝑡=𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎+∑βj∗𝑟𝑗,𝑡+𝜖𝑡𝑛
𝑗=1 
where 𝑟𝑝𝑡 is the monthly net return of the portfolio of funds over month t, 𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 is the regression’s intercept, 𝑟𝑓𝑡 
is the risk -free rate of return, 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 is the return o f the reference portfolio considered in the regression, 𝑛 is the number 
of reference portfolio s used, and 𝜖𝑡 is the error term. The return of the stock index portfolio is considered in excess 
of the risk -free rate. The coefficient’s t-statistics are provided between parentheses. Three, two , and one star indi-
cate a significance level of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively.

 Table V 
Performance models' estimates by fund self -reported investment objective  
This table presents coefficient estimates for the regression of monthly ret urns of value -weighted portfolios of mu-
tual funds on the returns of reference  portfolios on the period between January 1968 and December 2020. The 
sample comprises 26,407 U.S. domestic actively managed equity funds that existed sometime during this period.  
For each month during this period, monthly returns are averaged with the previous month 's TNA weights across 
all funds having the same investment objective during that month. There are eight mutual fund portfolios corre-
sponding to funds’ investment object ives, as indicated in the table. The set of reference  portfolios comprises UIRP , 
the CRSP value -weighted index considered as a proxy of the market portfolio, the SMB (for "Small Minus Big" 
capitalization stocks), "HML" (for "High Minus Low" book -to-market stocks), and “UMD” (for "Up Minus Down" 
prior stock returns) factor -mimicking portfolios. Alpha is estimated using various reference portfolio s in combi-
nation. The general performance model specification is  
𝑟𝑝𝑡−𝑟𝑓𝑡=𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎+∑βj∗𝑟𝑗,𝑡+𝜖𝑡𝑛
𝑗=1 
where 𝑟𝑝𝑡 is the monthly net return of the portfolio of funds over month t, 𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 is the regression’s intercept, 𝑟𝑓𝑡 
is the risk -free rate of return, 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 is the return of the reference  portfolio considered in the regr ession, 𝑛 is the number 
of reference portfolio s used, and 𝜖𝑡 is the error term. The return of the stock index portfolio is considered in excess 
of the risk -free rate. The coefficient’s t-statistics are provided between parentheses. Three, two , and on e star indi-
cate a significance level of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively.

 Table VI 
Alphas by deciles of expenses, turnover , and total net assets  
This table presents the intercept (alpha) from the regression of monthly returns of value -weighted portfolios of mutual funds on the re turns of reference  portfolios in the period 
between January 1968 and December 2020. The sample comprises 26,407 U.S. domestic actively managed equity funds that existed sometime during this period. For each 
month during this period, monthly returns are ave raged based on the previous month 's TNA weights across all funds belonging to the same decile of fund characteristics during 
that month. The characteristics considered are expenses, turnover , and TNA (Total Net Assets). TNA is the closing market value of s ecurities owned, plus all assets minus all 
liabilities. “Turnover” (over the calendar year) is the minimum of aggregate purchases of securities or aggregate sales of se curities divided by the average TNA of the fund. 
“Expenses” (over the calendar year) des ignates the percentage of the total investment that shareholders pay for the mutual fund operating expenses. Each month, fund s are 
ranked in ten deciles according to the corresponding characteristic. Then, each month we form a TNA -weighted portfolio of all  funds during a given decile, which gives us ten 
portfolios of mutual funds that correspond to the ten deciles considered. The set of reference  portfolios comprises UIRP , the CRSP value -weighted index considered as a proxy 
for the market portfolio, the SMB  (for "Small Minus Big" capitalization stocks), "HML" (for "High Minus Low" book -to-market stocks), and “UMD” (for "Up Minus Down" 
prior stock returns) factor -mimicking portfolios. Alpha is estimated using various reference portfolio s in combination. The g eneral performance model specification is  
𝑟𝑝𝑡−𝑟𝑓𝑡=𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎+∑βj∗𝑟𝑗,𝑡+𝜖𝑡𝑛
𝑗=1 
where 𝑟𝑝𝑡 is the monthly net return of the portfolio of funds over month t, 𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 is the regression’s intercept, 𝑟𝑓𝑡 is the risk -free rate of return, 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 is the return of the reference 
portfolio  portfolio considered in the regression, 𝑛 is the number of reference portfolio s used, and 𝜖𝑡 is the error term. The return of the stock index portfolio is considered in 
excess of th e risk -free rate. The coefficient’s t-statistics are between parentheses. Three, two , and one star indicate a significance level of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively.

 Table VII 
Alphas by deciles of fund degree of active management, 𝑹𝟐 
This table presents the intercept (alpha) from the regression of monthly returns of valu e-weighted portfolios of mutual funds on the returns of reference  portfolios on the period 
between January 1968 and December 2020. The sample comprises 20,526 U.S. domestic actively managed equity funds that existed sometime during this period and for whic h 
there is sufficient dat a to calculate the degree of active management. For each month during this period, monthly returns are averaged using  the previous month 's TNA weights 
across all funds belonging to the same decile of fund degree of active managemen t during that month. We measure active management as follows. We decompose the period of 
fund data availability  in three -year periods and then calculate a given fund’s 𝑅2 by projecting its monthly returns on the returns of the stock market index (marke t model) or the 
stock market index together with the factor -mimicking portfolios used in Carhart (1997). We retain only funds with a minimum number of 30 available monthly returns per 
period. 𝑅2 represents the degree of fund active management for the p eriod during which it is determined and is updated each period. The portfolio of funds in each decile is 
determined as follows. First, each month funds are ranked in ten deciles according to their 𝑅2. Then, we form a TNA -weighted portfolio of all funds  in a given decile, which 
gives us ten portfolios of mutual funds that correspond to the ten deciles considered. The set of reference  portfolios comprises UIRP , the CRSP value -weighted index considered 
as a proxy of the market portfolio, the SMB (for "Smal l Minus Big" capitalization stocks), "HML" (for "High Minus Low" book -to-market stocks), and “UMD” (for "Up Minus 
Down" prior stock returns) factor -mimicking portfolios. Alpha is estimated using various reference portfolio s in combination. The general perf ormance model specification is  
𝑟𝑝𝑡−𝑟𝑓𝑡=𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎+∑βj∗𝑟𝑗,𝑡+𝜖𝑡𝑛
𝑗=1 
where 𝑟𝑝𝑡 is the monthly net return of the portfolio of funds over month t, 𝐴𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 is the regression’s intercept, 𝑟𝑓𝑡 is the risk -free rate of re turn, 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 is the return of the reference 
portfolio s considered in the regression, 𝑛 is the number of reference portfolio s used, and 𝜖𝑡 is the error term. The return of the stock index portfolio is considered in excess of 
the risk -free rate. The coefficient’s t-statistics are between parentheses. Three, two , and one star indicate a significance level of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively.
