Trading Strategies
Yash Sharma
Abstract
A large class of trading strategies focus on opportunities o ﬀered by the yield curve. In partic-
ular, a set of yield curve trading strategies are based on the view that the yield curve mean-
reverts. Based on these strategies’ positive performance, a multiple pairs trading strategy on ma-
jor currency pairs was implemented. To improve the algorith m’s performance, machine learning
forecasts of a series of pertinent macroeconomic variables were factored in, by optimizing the
weights of the trading signals. This resulted in a clear impr ovement in the APR over the evalua-
tion period, demonstrating that macroeconomic indicators , not only technical indicators, should
be considered in trading strategies.
1. Yield Curve
The Yield Curve is a line that plots the interest rate, at a set point in time, of bonds having
equal credit quality but di ﬀering maturity dates. The U.S. Treasury Yield Curve is used a s a
benchmark for other debt in the market, and can also be used to predict changes in economic
output and growth. The shape of the yield curve gives an idea o f future interest rate changes
and economic activity. An inverted yield curve is often a har binger of recession. A positively
sloped yield curve is often a harbinger of inﬂationary growt h. These predictive properties make
the yield curve quite applicable in devising successful tra ding strategies.
Many yield curve trading strategies are based on the convent ional view that the yield curve
mean-reverts to some historical norm. This market view is co nsistent with historical experience.
For instance, U.S. Treasury bill rates, spreads and curvatu re all trade within tight, ﬁnite bounds.
The interest rate term structures in other countries also ex hibit similar patterns. This suggests
that some form of mean-reversion mechanism is at work that pr events the yield curve from drift-
ing to extreme levels or shapes over time.
In [1], three classes of mean-reverting trading strategies were considered, focusing on three
aspects of the yield curve: level, spread, and curvature. Fo r each strategy, the holding period
of a trade was ﬁxed at one month, after which a new trade was ini tiated. The condition of cash
neutrality was imposed, so that any excess cash was deposite d at the 1-month tenor. Similarly,
if additional funding was required, that was also carried ou t at the 1-month tenor. A 102-month
training period was allowed in the construction of the uncon ditional yield curve, so that the cal-
culation of the average payo ﬀof each yield curve strategy starts from January 1973 to Dece mber2000.1
These mean-reverting trading strategies were compared to t wo benchmarks, investment in
the Lehman Brothers U.S. Government Intermediate Bond Inde x, and cash-neutral investment in
the S&P index.2
The performance analysis indicated that a yield spread mean -reverting trading strategy per-
forms remarkably well compared to the benchmarks. The month ly payoﬀis about 5.1 times that
of the monthly payo ﬀof the equity benchmark, hence outperforming an equity inve stment strat-
egy, on a risk-adjusted basis. Furthermore, it outperforme d the bond benchmark, with an average
monthly payoﬀof about 5.9 times that of the benchmark.3
A paired-t test and the Diebold-Mariano statistical test (D -M test) [2] was conducted to test
whether the strategy signiﬁcantly outperforms the benchma rks. The tests were successful; even
when transaction costs were accounted for, the yield spread mean-reverting strategy was still
signiﬁcantly more proﬁtable than both of the benchmarks und er all measures.4
As the yield curve is highly correlated with changes in econo mic activity, the yield spread
mean reverting is a strong justiﬁcation for trading upon the mean reversion of the spread, in-
dependent of the ﬁnancial instrument used. Therefore, a Mul tiple Pairs trading strategy was
implemented.
2. Multiple Pairs Trading
A Pairs Trade is a strategy based on securities involved in th e pair having a mean-reverting
nature. The goal is to match two trading vehicles, trading on e long and the other short when the
pair’s price ratio diverges. The number of standard deviati ons the pair’s price ratio diverges in
order to initiate a trade is determined through historical d ata analysis. If the pair reverts to its
mean trend, a proﬁt is made.
In our implementation, currency pairs were used. Daily data from January 2008 to June 2014
for each of the major currency pairs was retrieved through Ya hoo Finance.
The currency pair price series were plotted, shown in Figure 1. Clearly, the series do not look
stationary. In order to perform a pairs trade, we desire a sta tionary pair, as the spread is ﬁxed,
and hence statistically the pair is mean reverting.
Consider a pair of non-stationary time series. If a particul ar linear combination of these series
will lead to a stationary series, the pair of series are terme d cointegrated. In order to ﬁnd that
particular combination, one needs to utilize tests for unit roots.

2.1. Cointegration
One would normally test for cointegration using the Augment ed Dickey-Fuller test (ADF)
[3]. However, a big drawback of that test is that it is only cap able of being applied to two sep-
arate time series. However, one can imagine a set of three or m ore ﬁnancial assets that might
share an underlying cointegrated relationship. Hence the J ohansen test is used, which can be
seen as a multivariate generalization of the ADF test. [4]Th e maximum number of currency
pairs that can be combined in one relationship was set to 4. Th is gives the algorithm more ﬂexi-
bility, as all combinations of two, three, or four separate t ime series were tested for cointegration.
Before applying the Johansen test, or any unit root test for t hat matter, one must ensure that
all the series are integrated of order 1. Technically, if two or more series are individually inte-
grated, but some linear combination of them has a lower order of integration, then the series are
said to be cointegrated. So, to guarantee that the cointegra ted series is stationary, the time series
need to be I(1). A price series is I(1) if the levels contain a u nit root, meaning the price series is
at least I(1), and the di ﬀerenced prices are stationary, I(0), meaning the price seri es is not I(2).
The ADF test with the general regression equation was used, a ssuming the series has drift
but no linear trend, in order to test for the existence of a uni t root. Lags are included in the
ADF formulation, allowing for higher-order autoregressiv e processes. The BIC information cri-
terion is used to select the optimal lag length. [5] This crit erion is used for consistency reasons
due to the large sample size. Though ine ﬃcient, the criterion delivers asymptotically correct
3results. Finally, the maximum lag length is chosen by the rul e of thumb formula, proposed by
Schwert, in [6]. The ADF test is performed on the levels and th e diﬀerenced levels, and the test
values were compared with the critical value at the 95% conﬁd ence level to generate conclusions.
Each of the major currency pair price series were conclusive ly found to be I(1), and hence
were used in the Johansen test. For the Johansen test, the V AR optimal solution lag length needs
to be found. Again, the series was assumed to have drift but no linear trend, and the lag length
was found by minimizing the SC information criterion for, ag ain, the large sample size. Again,
though ineﬃcient, it provides asymptotically correct results. A lagge d V AR is used in the Jo-
hansen procedure, so 1 is subtracted from the optimal V AR lag length.
The Johansen procedure was then initiated, again with the as sumption of drift but no linear
trend. The trace statistic was used, where the null hypothes is is that the number of cointegration
vectors is less than or equal to the total number of vectors te sted. Lastly, the longrun speciﬁcation
for error correction was used.
91 combinations of time series were tested for cointegratio n, and 16 were found to be coin-
tegrated. The spreads of the cointegrated portfolios were p lotted, shown in Figure 2.
As can be seen, the half life for each of the spreads was comput ed. Ignoring the drift
and lagged diﬀerence terms, the di ﬀerential form of the spread is equivalent to the Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck stochastic process [7]. The di ﬀerential form leads to an analytical solution for the
expected value of the portfolio spread which, for a mean-rev erting process with negative λ, tells
us that the expected value of the price decays exponentially at a half-life of−log(2)/λ.λ, which
measures the speed of an O-U process returning to its mean lev el, can be estimated from a linear
regression of the daily change of the spread versus the sprea d itself. In order to perform this
calculation, the spread and transaction costs are needed fo r the portfolio, and computing these
costs will be discussed subsequently when the mean reversio n strategy execution is described.
2.2. Execution
Finally, a mean reversion strategy was executed on each of th e cointegrated spreads. Firstly,
the spread and transaction costs that are incurred when buyi ng/selling the cointegrated portfolio
at the corresponding timestamp were computed. This computa tion depends on the individual
price series of the instruments within the portfolio, and th e optimal eigenvector associated with
the results of the cointegration test. The eigenvectors gen erated from the Johansen test can be
used as hedge ratios. The optimal eigenvector is the one that has the maximum eigenvalue, as it
has the shortest half life.
The spread is calculated by multiplying the hedge ratio valu es with their associated price
values and a summation is made. If the portfolios are cointeg rated, the resulting spread will be
stationary.
The absolute value of the hedge ratio represents the number o f units of each currency pair
that we buy or sell. Hence, the total transaction costs can be computed with a summation on
these amounts multiplied by the transaction costs per unit f or each currency pair.

Figure 2: Cointegrated Spreads
The mean and standard deviation of the spread were computed i n order to calculate the z
score, which simply represents the number of standard devia tions separating the current price
from the mean. If the z score is positive, the current price of the security is above the mean. If
the z score is negative, the current price of the security is b elow the mean. Hence, the z score is
used to generate the mean reversion trading signals.
The entry z score was set to 1 and the exit z score was set to 0. Th ese values set the extreme
values, or thresholds, which when crossed by the signal, tri gger trading orders. Entry into a long
position is made if the z score is less than the negated entry s core. Exit from a long position is
made if the z score is greater than the negated exit score. Ent ry into a short position is made if
the z score is greater than the entry score. Exit from a short p osition is made if the z score is less
than the exit score.
With this, the long /short positions were set, yielding the number of units of the portfolio
bought or sold at each timestamp. The USD capital allocation to buy the portfolio, speciﬁcally
the USD capital invested in each currency pair at each timest amp, was found by computing the
product between the hedge ratio matrix, which represents th e hedge ratio of each currency pair
at each timestamp, and the price matrix, which represents th e price of each currency pair at each
timestamp.
Using these computations, the P&L of the strategy at each tim estamp was computed. Trans-
5action costs were subtracted from this value, and Return was found by dividing the resulting
P&L by the gross market value of the portfolio. From the retur n, the APR, Sharpe Ratio, and
Maximum Drawdown of the strategy was computed. The spread (w /half life), the standardized
spread with color-coding indicating the long and short posi tions, the daily returns, and the cu-
mulative returns were all plotted. Furthermore, the averag e and standard deviation of the daily
returns, the APR, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown result s were all reported.
For the forthcoming analysis, a cointegrated portfolio was randomly selected. The chosen
portfolio consists of a combination of AUDUSD, CADUSD, NZDU SD, and JPYUSD currency
pairs. The results generated after backtesting the strateg y is shown in Figure 3

3. Macroeconomic Indicators
Our goal was to use macroeconomic indicators to improve upon the implemented Multiple
Pairs trading strategy. By generating buy /sell/hold signals based upon the forecasts of the cho-
sen variables, and combining these signals with the mean rev erting signal, we hoped to obtain
improved performance.
There is much history with improving a Pairs Trading Strateg y by factoring in additional
variables, however the indicators chosen have typically be en technical, and not macroeconomic.
6In [8], the authors’ implemented Pairs Trading model was ext ended to take into account
technical indicators. Rather than only considering the spr ead of the price, technical indicator
movements were also considered. Technical indicators whic h were selected exhibited similar be-
haviors for both securities: Simple moving average (SMA), W eighted moving average (WMA),
Money ﬂow index (MFI), and Relative strength index (RSI). T- scores were computed for the
price and the selected indicators, and a trained SVM was appl ied to the test dataset to make the
ﬁnal trading decisions.
This decision is typical, to not only use the price spread but other indicators intrinsic to
the currency pair being traded. However, little exploratio n has been done for considering how
macroeconomic movements reﬂecting the overall economy can improve trading performance. As
currency pairs are representative of foreign exchange rate s, with a downturn /upturn in the U.S.
economy, a increase /decrease in the prices of currency pairs relative to the U.S. Dollar should
take place.
Therefore, macroeconomic indicators which exhibit moveme nts that are correlated with the
strengthening/weakening of the U.S. Dollar were considered.
3.1. S&P 500
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price Index was use d. The S&P Index Com-
mittee chooses the indexed stocks based upon market size, li quidity and industry group repre-
sentation. Component companies are periodically replaced . Companies are most often removed
because of a merger with another company, ﬁnancial operatin g failure or restructuring. Prospec-
tive companies are placed in an index ”replacement pool” and vacancies are ﬁlled from that pool.
The index is designed to measure changes in the stock prices o f component companies. It
is used as a measure of the nation’s stock of capital, as well a s a gauge of future business and
consumer conﬁdence levels. With that growth, the U.S. Dolla r should strengthen.
3.2. Federal Funds
The eﬀective Federal Funds Rate was also used. It is the interest ra te at which a deposi-
tory institution lends funds maintained at the Federal Rese rve to another depository institution
overnight. The higher the federal funds rate, the more expen sive it is to borrow money. Since
it is only applicable to very creditworthy institutions for extremely short-term (overnight) loans,
the federal funds rate can be viewed as the base rate that dete rmines the level of all other interest
rates in the U.S. economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is the Feder al Reserves primary mon-
etary policymaking body, telegraphs its desired target for the federal funds rate through open
market operations. A rise in the Federal Funds Rate indicate s the FOMC attempting to curb bur-
geoning economic growth to prevent an inﬂationary period, a nd therefore the U.S. Dollar should
strengthen.
3.3. 10-Year Treasury
The 10-Year Treasury Note Yield at Constant Maturity was als o used. The Treasury Yield is
the return on investment, expressed as a percentage, on the U .S. government’s debt obligations
7(bonds, notes and bills). From another perspective, it is th e interest rate the U.S. government
pays to borrow money for di ﬀerent lengths of time.
The 10-Year Treasury in particular tends to signal investor conﬁdence. When conﬁdence is
high, the ten-year treasury bond’s price drops and yields ri se because investors feel they can ﬁnd
higher returning investments and do not feel the need to play it safe. But when conﬁdence is low,
the price increases and yields fall as there is more demand fo r safe investment. Therefore, the
higher the yield on long-term bonds like the 10-Year Treasur y, the better the economic outlook,
and the stronger the U.S. dollar.
4. Macroeconomic Forecasts
Each of the indicators were forecast in order to generate a tr ading signal. A Support Vec-
tor Machine was utilized for this purpose. Support Vector Ma chines, or SVMs, are supervised
learning models with associated learning algorithms that a nalyze data used for classiﬁcation and
regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of mul-
tiple categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model t hat assigns new examples to one
of the categories, making it a multiclass non-probabilisti c linear classiﬁer. An SVM model is a
representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate
categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possib le. New examples are then mapped
into that same space and predicted to belong to a category bas ed on which side of the gap they fall.
Support Vector Machines have been found to particularly sho w excellent performance in the
ﬁeld of time series prediction. [9] SVMs can accurately fore cast time series data when the un-
derlying system processes are typically nonlinear, nonsta tionary and not deﬁned apriori.
However, forecasting the exact value that the macroeconomi c indicators would hold on a
month-to-month basis is a infeasible problem, even for SVMs . A vast amount of feature engi-
neering would need to be done, which is both di ﬃcult and expensive. Variables would need to be
created using domain knowledge of the data to give the SVM the adequate data needed to make
accurate forecasts. But, for our purposes, forecasting the direction in which the macroeconomic
indicators move would be su ﬃcient, and this is certainly a easier problem to solve.
An SVM was trained on monthly data, acquired through the Have r Analytics Database, from
1995-2008, in order to successfully forecast whether the in dicator of note increased, decreased,
or stayed constant in the evaluation period, 2008-2014, on a month-by-month basis. With little
feature engineering, a classiﬁcation accuracy of 70% was yi elded.
With these monthly forecasts, a trading signal can be genera ted. If the forecast details that the
indicator will stay constant, a ”hold” position was taken. I f instead it predicts that the indicator
will increase, then a ”sell /short” position was taken, and if a decrease is predicted, a ” buy/long”
position was taken. This is because if, for example, the indi cator were to increase, the value of
the major currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar would decre ase, meaning a ”sell /short” position
should be taken.
These monthly signals were normalized to daily signals, in o rder to be compared with the
mean reverting signal.
85. Signal Weighting
In order to combine the 4 signals into one, the signals were on e-hot encoded. If each of the
possible signals were encoded with nominal values, the ordi nal property would cause greater
values to have greater weight. Instead, a boolean vector is g enerated for each possible position,
and only one of these vectors can take on the value ”1” for each sample.
With the signals one-hot encoded, each possible signal now m athematically is equal in value.
With that, a weight vector was generated which signiﬁes how m uch weight will be given to each
indicator’s signal. The weights were bounded on the range 0 t o 1, and these weights were then
optimized using Sequential Least-Squares Programming (SL SQP), an iterative method for non-
linear optimization. The objective function here was the AP R, and the near negligible transaction
costs were not considered for the optimization.
The results are summarized in the following table:
10-Year S&P 500 Federal Funds Mean Reversion APR
0 0 0 1 4.084%
0.5 0.5 0.75 1 4.112%
Table 1: Optimization Results
If only the mean reverting signal was considered, an APR of 4. 084% was yielded. After op-
timization, giving non-zero weight to the macroeconomic in dicators was found to be ideal, with
a increased APR of 4.112% obtained. With an evaluation perio d spanning 6 years and only 3
macroeconomic signals stemming from satisfactory forecas ts considered, this is certainly a sig-
niﬁcant improvement.
The full backtested results can be seen in Figure 4, and can be compared to the results gener-
ated using solely the mean reverting signal, summarized in F igure 3. The lessening in the APR is
due to the transaction costs factored in. Qualitatively eva luating the positions taken by examining
the plot on the upper-right reveals the beneﬁt to giving non- zero weight to the macroeconomic
signals.
Comparing the historical positions taken reveals a similar pattern, except for the 2008-2010
period. The recession in the United States spanned the major ity of that time, beginning Decem-
ber 2007 and ending June 2009. During this time, rather than c ontinuing to rapidly transition
between taking short and long positions based solely on the l evel of the spread, the macroeco-
nomic indicators inﬂuenced the strategy to simply hold a sho rt position throughout that time,
betting that though the U.S. dollar was weak during this rece ssionary phase, it should revert
back to the mean. That decision was the signiﬁcant di ﬀerence between the strategies, and what
primarily net the improvement in performance.

6. Conclusion
The Yield Curve is a strong economic indicator, and studies s uggest that trading upon the
mean-reverting nature of its spread yields statistically s igniﬁcant positive performance results.
Due to that, a Multiple Pairs Trading Strategy was implement ed using major currency pairs. Us-
ing the Johansen test, stationary cointegrated portfolios were yielded from the major currency
pairs considered. With that, a mean reversion strategy was e xecuted, by computing z scores
and comparing them to the entry and exit thresholds. The repr esentative cointegrated portfolio
yielded a APR of 4.084%. By using a SVM to generate monthly for ecasts on a set of macroe-
conomic indicators, trading signals for each of the indicat ors considered were obtained. After
optimizing upon the weights for each of the indicators, it wa s found that giving the macroeco-
nomic signals nonzero weights yielded an APR of 4.112%, an im provement upon the original
strategy. With a large evaluation period and a small indicat or set, this improvement is signiﬁcant
and demonstrates that macroeconomic indicators can certai nly improve trading strategies.
