Highlights  
• The significant factors of the choice of investment in cryptocurrency  include age, 
gender, education, occupation, and previous investment experience.  
• Chinese and Australian investors rank the ICO attributes differently.  
• The deterrence factors, and investment strategies vary between Chinese and 
Australians.  
 Abstract 
This study investigate s the soci o-demographic  characteristics that individual 
cryptocurrency investors exhibit and the  factors which go into their investment decisions  in 
different Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). A web -based revealed preference survey was 
conducted among Australian and Chinese blockchain and cryptocurrency followers , and a 2 
 Multinomial L ogit model  was applied  to inferentially analyze the characte ristics of 
cryptocurrency investors and the determinants of the  choice of investment in “cryptocurrency 
coins” versus other types of ICO tokens . The results show a difference between the determinant 
of these two choices among Australian and Chinese cryptoc urrency folks . The significant 
factors of the se two choices include age, gender, education, occupation, and investment 
experience, and they align well with the behavioural literature. Furthermore, alongside 
differences in how they rank the attributes of IC Os, there is further variance between how 
Chinese and Australian investors rank deterrence factors and investment strategies.

1. Introduction  
With the emergence of the internet and its subsequent rapid growth in last few decades, the 
invention of the blockchain based on the modern internetwork seems to be an unsurprising 
product  of this new era  (Zhou et al., 2016) . Since the creation of the first cryptocurrency, 
Bitcoin, in 2008 (Nakamoto, 2008) , the cryptocurrency market has experienced exponential 
growth in the ten  years following its inception. This in turn has  turned cryptocurrency into one 
of the most attractive and fascinating buzzword s in the world. F rom less than 0.01 USD  worth 
of bitcoin in 2010 to above 10,000 USD  each in 2019, and from a single bitcoin to more than 
1000 altcoins and crypto -tokens , cryptocurrency and blockchain ha ve created more  invest ment 
myth s than anyone could have imagine d.  
The emergence of the underlying blockchain  technology of decentralization and distributed 
ledgers has undoubtedly  begun to bring revolutionary changes across many fields. A relatively 
recent and novel financial innovation is the so -called initial coin offerin g (ICO).  The ICO,  3 
 which relies on blockchain technology, is a niche form of crowd -funding used by blockchain 
startup ventures  to launch a business based on distributed ledger or blockchain technology 
(Chanson, Gjoen, Risius, & Wortmann, 2018) . Similar to Initial Pub lic Offerings (IPOs), which  
the term ICO derives from , ICOs  allow a company to issue transferable tokens to the general 
public which can be traded on open markets such as a cryptocurrency exchange. U nlike 
traditional fundraising mechanisms, the issued toke ns can contain variable properties in 
representing their values, and this is most  often  the access to the firm’s  products and services 
(Sehra, Smith, & Gomes, 2017; Tapscott and Tapscott, 2017) .  The other difference is that 
participants in an ICO exchange cryptocurrencies that may or may not have rights attached. 
The issued token does not convey the ownership i n the start -up company but can bring certain 
rights such as voting. Presumed interest in cryptocurrency , which comes from a fear of missing 
out on an opportunity, has led to  a 15.2% growth in ICOs,  with approximately 11.5 billion USD 
raised in 20181. 
Although the ICO is still a very recent phenomenon in fundraising compare d to traditional 
financing, it has been increasingly used by companies as a n easy way to  raise funds. The 
existing literature studying ICOs  has focused on the determina nts of the success of ICOs, 
however  the body of literature  is relatively scarce in  investigating the characteristics of 
cryptocurrency investors.   
This study aims to use choice modeling to examine the characteristics of investors and their 
choice s regarding the type s of ICOs  they invest in . By understanding what characteristics 
investors exhibit and what factors go into their investment decisions, this study aims to develop 
a better understanding of how firms, particularly those running ICOs, can better attract

 investors and thereby further the expansion of the technology’s applications despite current 
perceptions.  
Accordingly, we conducted a revealed preference (RP) experiment where blockchain folks 
were asked about their investment behaviors, their ICO preferences, and other att itudinal 
factors relating to  risk and ICO attributes. We also conducted the same survey in China 
(translated in to Mandarin) so as to compare the similarities and differences of investor 
characteristics as well as the perceived cryptocurrency landscapes  across both countries . The 
attributes that might be relevant to investment in  cryptocurrency have  been  borrowed from  the 
literature on behavioral theories, similar studies, and brainstorming with representatives of 
cryptocurrency investors. We have applied the Multinomial Logit model to model the choice 
of investment in cryptocurrency as well as choice of investing in c oins versus tokens.  
This study indicates that  the gender, age, income level, background education, and job of 
individuals  are among the determinants of cryptocurrency investment. Notably, this study finds 
evidence which aligns  well with theories of risk -aversion in behavioral economics and finance.  
The rest o f paper is organized as follows. S ection 2 describes the research background and 
literature review with regards to the determinant factors in cryptocurrency investment. The 
experiment , methodology, and model specifications  are described in S ection 3. The results of 
the estimation of the models are presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents the descriptive 
statistics about ICO attributes, investment strategies , and friction factors of investment. Finally,  
concluding remarks are presented in Section 6.  
 
2. Literature review  and research background  
In this section, we summarize the literature into two  main  categories : investors’  
characteristics, and ICO attributes . 5 
 2.1. Investors’  char acteristic s 
Different characteristics of investors in financial markets determine different preferences  
in financial instruments and different levels of financial risk -taking.  Accordingly, the research 
on the  factor s influenc ing investor behavior  is essential for blockchain- related start -ups to be 
successful . However, the literature in studying investor s behaviors and characteristics in 
cryptocurrencies is relatively scant . There are only a few noteworthy examples of experimental 
studies and descriptive snapshots of cryptocurre ncy investor characteristics and ICO attributes . 
Foley and Lardner LLP (2018)  investigated investor perceptions of cryptocurrencies and 
found that regulation to reduce uncertainty is key for investors going forward. A  survey from 
Encrybit1 provides descriptive statistics from 161 countries on the impacts of several variables 
on cr yptocurrency investment, namely token exchanges, risk management, news , and social 
networks.  
Another  survey2 on Reddit presents  a descriptive snapshot of investor characteristics from 
age and gender through to portfolio size and ideologica l justifications. A study by Mahomed 
(2017)  is the only study using inferential  statistical analysis where they investigated consumer 
adoption of cryptocurrencies through the lens of behavior al biases. Other than the descriptive 
snapshots shown in Exhibit 1, there is no study about the characteristics that may play a role in 
cryptocurrency investments.

When reviewing the literature , we also looked at the  findings obtained from the traditional 
financial market in understanding investor s characteristics. For example, f inancial risk 
tolerance is  found to be a fundamental dimension to explain investor behavior  and has been 
widely studied in the financial literature  (Bucciol and Zarri, 2015; Grable, 2000) . Financial risk 
tolerance  simply indicates the maximum tolerance and willingness of someone to take risk s in

 making financial decisions . Fisher and Yao (2017)  noted that in an efficient market, investors 
who take larger risks would expect higher returns. As such, investors with a higher level of risk 
tolerance are expected to hold assets with a significantly higher level of risk in order to obtain 
a higher return in the long run. As  mentioned in the previous section,  ICOs appear to be moving 
towards becoming efficien t markets and consequently we assume that the literature of risk 
tolerance char acteristics based on traditional financial markets are, to some extent, applicable 
to ICO and cryptocurrency market s. 
A vast literature indicates that me n, on average, are more likely to have a higher risk 
tolerance when making financial decisions compared to women  (Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 
1999; Charness and Gneezy, 2012; Jacobsen, Lee, Marquering, & Zhang, 2014; Lemaster and 
Strough, 2014; Neelakantan, 2010; Sung and Hanna, 1996) . Deo and Sundar (2015)  confirmed 
this hypothesis in the investment behaviors displayed in the  India n stock market and suggested 
that this might be due to the different gender behaviors .  They found that men are more likely 
to have a higher risk tolerance level because they are relatively more active investors and make 
more investment decisions on a daily basis. Almenberg and Dreber (2015)  argued that financial 
literacy could explain the significant gender gap in the stock market, suggesting that women 
are less likely to participate in the stock market due to a lower level of  financial literacy. Fisher 
and Yao (2017)  suggested that the gender gap of risk tolerance mainly comes from income 
uncertainties. They observed that women have less yearly income compared to men and 
consequently may need to keep a larger portion of money in accounts with low returns (low 
risk) to bare the possible negative income shocks. Barber and Odean (2001)  links  this 
difference to psychology and argues  that men are more prone to overconfidence than women.  
Furthermore, literature on the  correlation between age difference and risk -taking activities  
is controversial . Some found that older individuals have a higher risk tolerance than younger 
individuals  (Morin and Suarez, 1983) . Others found that younge r age groups were, on average, 8 
 willing to take risks at a much higher frequency than older age groups which were at or near  to 
retirement age (Finke and Huston, 2003; Grable, 2000) .  Wang and Hanna (1997)  studied the  
U.S. households’ risk tolerance and found that the proportion of risky assets held by households 
increased as people aged, indicat ing a higher risk tolerance amongst the elderly. They 
suggested that this may be due to the limited financial resources  or income of youths , causing 
younger people  to have less capacity for enduring short -term investment losses.   
People with higher income s are willing to take more financial risks than those with lower 
incomes (Carducci and Wong, 1998; Finke and Huston, 2003; Grable, 2000; Roszkowski and 
Grable, 2010) . Similarly, Morin and Suarez (1983)  studied the risky assets held by Canadian 
individuals  and concluded that risk tolerance, to some extent, depends on the levels of net worth. 
They found that  risk tolerance decreases  as age increases  for households wh ich have low levels 
of net worth. In contrast, for the households wh ich have higher levels of net wor th, the risk 
tolerance increases with age. However, Riley and Chow (1992)  observed a different pattern of 
holding assets in  American  households. They found that household risk tolerance is positively 
correlated with age  until they reach 65 after which there is a negative correlation . Their results, 
however, confirmed the discussions above that risk tolerance is related to net wea lth. They  
showed that risk aversion decreased significantly as an individual’s wealth r ose into the top 10% 
of the population.  
We can, therefore, reasonably concluded that women are more risk -averse than men, the 
young are more risk -seeking than the old, wealthier individuals manifest a greater willingness 
to invest in riskier assets,  and the poor are risk -averse (Ndirangu, Ouma, & Munyaka, 2014) . 
 
2.2. ICO attributes   
Coins and tokens are two terms used to describe the unit of cryptocurrency value and are 
used to transfe r value as a means of payment similar to money. However, tokens have a wider 9 
 functionality than coins such as delivering value to investors beyond speculative returns and 
holding votes on key business decisions such as technical or protocol changes to the platform.  
Cryptocurrencies can be categorized into: (i) ‘currency’ coins which grant the right to 
another digital currency to holders; (ii) ‘asset/platform’ tokens which grants the right to a promised future cash flow linked to an underlying business; (ii i) ‘utility’ tokens that grant the 
right to access a product or service that the startup provides usually at some future point; and (iv) ‘security’ tokens which confer rights to an equity stake in a business and are used to invest 
or trade on the market. B ased on the type of use -cases, business, and platform, these categories 
can be further broken down, with, for example, the website ‘icobench.com’ displaying 28 
categories, with platform, cryptocurrency, and business services currently amongst the top 
three  by quantity (Exhibit 2) . 
 
Exhibit 2: The categories of ICOs (source: icobench.com, retrieved in May 2019)  
Overall, these different types of cryptocurrencies can be grouped into two major categories 
of coins and tokens.  Coins present a group of alternative coins as an alternative to fiat money 
while tokens present the cryptocurrencies associated with their the ther  use-cases of blockchain 
rathe r than the concept of cryptocurrency. 2997

 The main body of scientific literature focuses on what makes an ICO successful, with 
results ranging from the quality of its whitepaper through to how well it has built upon network 
effects via communities and social m edia.  Information asymmetry is always the core problem 
influencing investor trust as well as the success of any form of fundraising activities,  and this  
has been widely studied in the literature (Chod and Lyandres, 2018) . This is a concept 
describing the fact that  fundraising companies have greater material knowledge than potential 
investors in the actual quality of their company or project (Firoozi, Jalilvand, & Lien, 2017) . 
In the traditional fundraising activities such as IPO s and ventur e capital, this information 
asymmetry can be effectively alleviated by comprehen sive supervision and regulation, as 
disclosure regulation and enforcement are considered the foundations of well -functioning 
capital markets (Bourveau, George, Ellahie, & Macciocchi, 2018) . However, in the context of 
cryptocurrency, ICOs are not well regulated in most jurisdictions around the world, and this  
result s in a massive amount of misconduct and scams (Barsan and LL.M., 2017) . The ICO 
ventures know more about the quality of their project than those potential investors, put ting 
ICO investors in an informational disadvantage.  The ICO information asymmetry has been 
widely observed in the literature  (Felix, 2018; Momtaz, 2018) .  
Underpricing is a well -observed phenomenon in the process of IPO s where the initial price 
of the stock is set to be much lower than its intrinsic value. Information asymmetry is the most 
significant and accepted explanation of  underpricing.  Felix (2018)  found robust evidence that 
underpricing is even more common among  ICOs compared to IPOs, indicat ing a significant 
level of information asymmetry. Due to  information asymmetry and the information gap, 
investors are easily deceived. Howell, Niessner, &  Yermack (2018)  suggested that the liquidity 
and trading volume for tokens w ould be higher if the issuers took steps to reduce the 
information asymmetry.  11 
 However, if a  high level of information asymmetry continues to  exist in the  long-run, it 
could turn the ICO market into a market for lemons (Sehra, et al., 2017) . “The market for 
lemons” theory is firs t explored by economist Akerlof (1970) , which  explain s how the quality 
of goods trade d in a market will leave only bad quality product by studying the used car sales 
market. Sehra, et al. (2017)  concluded that t he ICO market is suffering from the “lemon” 
condition.  By studying the  five characteristics in defining a lemon market, they proposed that 
the ICO market contains a high level of information asymmetry, skewed incentives, lack of 
disclosure framework, low -quality product , and lack of assurance, all of which are common in  
a “lemon” market.   
Due to the absence of regulation or due diligence, investors can only rely on the information 
that the company want s them to know. “ Lemon” theory suggests that investors  in the market, 
therefore, are only willing to pay a portion of the  value  they think is appropriate for ICOs, 
leading to a vicious circle resulting in only the low quality and fraudulent ICOs left in the 
market. As low -quality ICOs increase in number  on th e market, the lemon market will 
eventually squeeze out all current and potential investors. Therefore, in order to gain more 
investors and build investor trust in the market, it is necessary to reduce the information asymmetry.  
A higher level of informati on asymmetry generally leads to a greater need for signaling 
(Allen and Faulhaber, 1989) . Signaling theory, first  proposed by Spence (1978) , can be applied  
to reduce the information asymmetry between two parties, assum ing that the issuer knows more 
than th e investor and is willing to signal the actual value . Signaling theory suggest s a very 
efficient way of describing issuer behavior, fundraising activities , and reducing the information 
asymmetry (Conne lly, Certo, Ireland, & Reutzel, 2010) . Generally, because of the existence of 
information asymmetry between ventures and investors, the ventures need to disclose credible 
information in order to verify the credibility and validity of their project (Kromidha and Robson, 12 
 2016) . Under a  high level of information asymmetry, the behaviour  of potential investors will 
depend on how the issuers send signals in order to encourage more investors  (Courtney, Dutta, 
& Li, 2017) .  
A technical white paper could be a sufficient signal in ICOs  (Fisch, 2019) . The white paper 
is an essential component of a venture’s ICO campaign which can be traced back to B itcoin  
(Nakamoto, 2008) . It is generally a document used by ventures to provide information which 
they deem necessary to show public ly (Barsan and LL.M., 2017) . A white paper usually 
disclos es and outline s the token distribution, business model , and other additional information 
related to the project. It is widely recognized as the main source of information for  potential 
investor s. A white paper should, therefore, be a reliable and informative tool for pote ntial 
investors.  
On the other hand, Chod and Lyandres (2018)  argued that unlike venture capital or other 
fundraising activities , the white paper is not a reliable tool for investors due to lack of 
regulations and investment protection schemes. As discussed by  Felix (2018)  cryptocurrencies 
are a new unknown and unregulated form of investing in which only a few people know the 
true characteristics of a  project. Fisch  (2019)  further suggests that ICOs typically occur in the 
early stages of a venture’s life cycle and the tokens often do not have any counter value or real -
world usage at the time of the ICO.  Additionally , Zetzsche, Buckley, Arner, &  Föhr (2017)  
suggest that more than half of the white papers on the ma rket do not disclose  project contact 
details, and an even higher number of white papers do not provide any underlying suitable legal 
support,  money, or funds supervision and compell ing audit . Momtaz (2018)  also suggested 
that white paper s are often designed  on a euphemistic way for luring investors , and 
consequently i nvestors cannot trust the white paper due to  a lack of proven track record  of ICO 
start-ups and lack of corporate governance  and regulations .  13 
 Instead of a white paper, Adhami, Giudici, &  Martinazzi (2018) argued that the success of 
an ICO mostly depends  on the source code shared  on the internet. They have found in studying 
various ICOs that the probability of the success of ICOs is unaffected by the availability of 
white pa pers, but is significantly positively affected by the availability  of the source codes. 
They explained that white papers revealed by ventures have  different information qualities, and 
the mere presence of one such document as an attachment to the ICO annou ncement is not 
particularly valued by potential investors, particularly due to lack of  regulat ions and audit s. By 
contrast, t he informative power of source codes is very significant , providing a valuable and 
tangible measurement to analyze the intrinsic value of the ICO project . 
Similarly, Fisch (2019)  found that high- quality source code is associ ated with the success 
of an ICO, and  suggested the source code is an objective feature for most investors in 
distinguishing different ICOs when making investment decisions. While one may argue that  
the quality of code is too technic al to be understood by the majority of investors,  the author 
argues that  through the availability of source codes, investors are assisted by the technical 
reviewers, website news, and  social media about  the underlying technological capabilities of 
the project.  Further,  Bourveau, et al. (2018)  reviewed  776 attempted ICOs and found that 
successful ICO s are more likely to reveal  their source cod es through GitHub disclosures or 
other publicly available code repositor ies. By contra st, ICOs  which did not disclose their source 
codes on those platforms were likely to be the one which failed to meet  fundraising goals . To 
explain  this phenomenon, they a rgued that compare d to “soft” or unaudited information 
disclosed in unverifiable ways, investors prefer more credible sources  of information such as 
source codes.  
A reliable scoring system could be another effective signal in ICOs , as suggested by Bian 
et al. (2018)  who found that a reliable c redit rating system is necessary and urgent for ICOs. 
An appropriate and well developed ICO rating could prevent individual investors from losses 14 
 by providing legality, transparency, and technical understanding to the market. Feng, Li, Lu, 
Wong, &  Zhang (2018)  also found a positive association between the ICO rating and the 
amount of funds raised. Boreiko and Vidusso (2019) again found that the probability  of success 
in ICO fundraising campaigns  is associated with extensive coverage in the ICO aggregators’ 
lists. However, they noted that the rating data and results vary considerably across different 
rating websites, and suggested  the investors should furth er investigate these rankings.  
Additionally , the majority of ICO rating mechanisms depend on the information revealed in  
white papers. Since many researchers argue that the white papers are not credible sources  of 
information, the current ICO rating websit e or mechanisms which largely depends on the white 
paper might be biased, and r ational investors might not take ICO rating s on the market as a 
trustworthy  source of measurement.  
According to this  literature review, the potential relevant attributes of the  investor’s 
characteristics as well as ICO attributes were extracted to be investigated in the experiment. 
Accordingly, the behavioural literature  highlights some investor charact eristics includ ing age, 
gender, education, occupation, and investment experie nce. The literature on ICO attributes also 
suggests a number of important factors, namely inside r information, advertis ing, fundraising 
strateg ies, source code, white paper s, and regulation. 
 
3. Methodology  
 3.1. Exper iment  
 A revealed preference (RP) survey was developed to collect data on preferences towards 
the investment, and the type of investment . The survey was simultaneously distributed among 
Chinese and Australian cryptocurrency folks. The simultaneity of data collect ion ensured the 
robust comparison between these two groups without impacts of price fluctuation. Both surveys 15 
 were distributed within cryptocurrency and blockchain related social network channels (e.g. 
Telegram, Slack, Wechat and Facebook)  and a number of blockchain- based or cryptocurrency -
enthusiast groups , meetups, and events.  
Data was collected with a Qualtrics -created web-based questionnaire.   The web -based 
survey ensured confidentiality through anonymous participation as well as randomizing the 
items t o avoid survey fatigue effects. The use of a web -based survey creates a sample that may 
not necessarily be representative of the whole population and may over -represent younger and 
educated participants. However, the topic of cryptocurrency itself may also attract these 
audiences more than other groups since buy and sell actions are also made through social media 
or online.  
The questionnaire  included 29 questions  and had an expected completion time of 10 
minutes . The questions focused on the theorized hypotheses according to the  prior research  
presented in the previous two section s. The questionnaire was divided into two sections. The 
first section involved personal data including gender , age , income level , job, and education. 
The second section investigated the ICO attributes , general attitudes , and perceptions about 
cryptocurrency  and ICOs .  
The investor’s characteristics, ICO features, and other relevant attributes were derived from  
a review of the literature  on behavioral financial investment , as outlined in the Section 2. The 
categorization of variables were mainly chosen based on the Census S tatistics , as reported by 
the Australian Bureau of Statistics1. In order to compare the results of the Australian and 
Chin ese datasets, we considered  the same categories for the Chinese survey  save for the income 
levels which were chosen according to the income quantiles  in China.

 The a dministration of the Australian survey resulted in 130 responses in 3 weeks of which 107 
complete ly answered all the questions. The administration of the Chinese survey resulted in 
485 responses of which 295 were complete and could be used for model estimation. The 
summary of the characteristics of the participants in the Australian and Chinese surveys has 
been presented in the  Appendix 1.  
3.2. Method  
Discrete choice models describe decision -makers’ choices among alternatives. Choice 
models are estimated under the assumption that decision- makers are utility maximizers . The 
utility of alternative  i for decision -maker n is expressed as the sum of a deterministic part V ni 
and a stochastic part εni (Train, 2009) : 
1 ni ni ni ni i ni UV k εε= + = + ++n2βX βZ         (1) 
where Xn is a vector of characteristics  of decision- maker  n, Zni is a vector of attributes of 
alternative i for decision maker n, vector s β1 and  β2 of fixed parameters associated to Xn and 
Zni, and k i is the alternative -specific constant that captures the average impact on utility of all 
factors that are not included in the model.   
The behavioral model is therefore choosing alternative i  if and only if U ni > Unj, ∀ j ≠ i. 
Expressing the probability of choosing alternative  i as a Logit model result s in the following 
probability (Train, 2009) :    
( )( )ni nj nj n i i ni j n n P Prob j i Pr U U VV ob j i εε = ∀≠ = − − ∀≠>      (2) 
Using the density f(ε n), this cumulative probability can be rewritten as  (Train, 2009) : 
ln( ( )) ( )nj ni n j n
nin ni n V P I ji V fd
εεε εε = − − ∀≠∑∫      (3) 17 
 Where I is an indicator function equaling “one”  when the term in parentheses is true and “zero”  
otherwise.  Assuming  the unobserved portion of utility ε ni is distributed IID  extreme value and 
a type of generalized extreme value, the eq. (3) has a closed form expression for this integral.  
Considering we have not collected the data about the type of cryptocurrency, we do not 
have Zni. It should be noted that  the characteristics of decision -maker s do not vary over the 
alternatives, and since they can only enter the model if create differences in utility over different 
alternatives. Hence, one of these parameters in one alternative is normalized to zero and the 
estimated β1 is interpreted as the differential effect of that parameter on the utility compared to 
the base alternative. Lastly, t he elements of the vectors β 1 are estimated by the maximum 
likelihood function,using PandasBiogeme  (Bierlaire, 2018).  
3.3. Model specification  
This section presents the specifications of the choice of investment and the type of 
investment. From all the information collected, all potential explanatory variab les were added 
progressively to test whether they were statistically significant at least at the 10% level and, if they were significant, they were retained in the model , otherwise they were removed. Finally, 
the best model specifications were determined after testing for all combinations of variables and checking for partial correlations.  Notably, the model specifications presented in the 
following sub- sections only include the variables which were statistically significant at the 10% 
of confidence level.  
3.3.1. Model specification for the choice of investment in cryptocurrency  
After specification testing, t he utility equations were  specified as shown in eqs .
(4-6), and 
eqs.(7-9) for the Australian and Chinese sur veys respectively.  It should be noted that the error 
terms are Gumbel distributed, and the equations present the deterministic parts of the utility functions.  18

4. Results 
This section presents the results of the model for two choices of investment and the type of 
investment. 
4.1. Model Results of the Choice of Investment in Cryptocurrency  
Respondent s were asked to reveal their investment behavior, and accordingly three 
alternatives have been modelled, namely the choice of investment in cryptocurrency up to now, 
the choice of never investing, and the intention of investing in future. In the Australian survey, 
78.2% of the observations have invested in cryptocurrencies , 11.9% plan on investing in the 
future, and 9.9% have not invested  and do not intend to do so. In the Chinese survey, these 
percentages are 29%, 27% , and 44% respectively.  
Exhibit 3 presents the parameters found within both  model s, all of which were found to be 
significant at the 95% level of confidence. The Australian model provides evidence of interest 
in cryptocurrency investment by those within information technology jobs which may be 
expected given their experience in the field. Interestingly, those who have experience investing 
in equities were less likely to be in terested in investing in the future. Further, females were 
more  likely to be considering investing in the future or never investing, which may indicate 21 
 they are more risk -averse  as was expected from the literature. Those who were earning between 
1000 AUD and 2500 AUD per week on average and those who have a job in banking sector 
were more likely to invest now.  
In the C hinese survey, individuals who belong to the age group 18 to 30 years old would 
be expected to have more risk tolerance , and they are relati vely more willing to invest in 
cryptocurrency. Additionally, individuals within the age group above 40 years old were more 
likely to invest in this market in  the future . However, when c omparing the goodness of fit , the 
significant parameters in the Chinese  model cannot strongly explain the choice of investment 
while the Australian model yields relatively satisfactory results .

4.2. Model results for the choice of cryptocurrency 22 
 In our survey, r espondents were asked to reveal their preferred ICOs to invest  in. 
Considering cryptocurrency investors often distribute their invest ments  across different types 
of ICOs, respondents could choose  multiple options  across seven  types of ICO tokens and coins, 
namely:  (1) currency coins;  (2) trading tokens such as trading energy, water, and healthcare; 
(3) commodity tokens such as supply chain of asset  or goods (i.e. diamond, food, and property); 
(4) identity management tokens; (5) social platform tokens such as Telegram and social betting; 
(6) cross -chain tokens; and (7) marketplace tokens such as Airbnb, buying and selling, and 
rental platfo rms. 
Some of the reasons given by respondents for their investment choices provides an insight into 
how perspectives may di ffer regarding the type of ICOs. Interestingly, the majority believe that 
currency coins are the most liquid option to invest and return a short -term profit while tokens 
are associated with startups and projects that either have long -term return or are doomed to fail. 
While in minority , the other types of use -case tokens also have their own advocates such as the 
alternative energy platforms to reduce carbon emissions and social platforms due to expected 
high value returns . 
Notably, currency coins such as Bitcoin, Binance,  and NEX are the most chosen  
alternative s as compared to the other types of ICO tokens . Consequently, two alternatives have 
been modelled, namely the choice of invest ing in coins  and the choice of investing in other 
types of ICO tokens . The reason for this grouping is that some blockchain advocates focus 
more on bitcoin and other coins as an alternative to fiat money, while others focus more on the  
use-cases of blockchain other  than the concept of cryptocurrency. 
The estimates presented in Exhibit 4 demonstrate the differential effect of th ese parameter s 
on the utility of coins  compared to the other ICO tokens . Accordingly, the Australian model 
provides evidence of interest in coin investment  by those who have a high income, ha ve studied  
IT, work as freelancer s or in the wholesale sector,  work in casual employment  or are 23 
 unemployed. However, people with the age of 18 to 30 prefer ot her use -cases of cryptocurrency. 
The Chinese survey reveals th at male investors, freelancers,  and those who have an investment 
in equity and/or fixed income prefer investment in coins .

5. Further discussions  
Generally, the main reasons that ICO s have been widely recognized as a disruptive and 
revolutionary technological innovation are its fundraising attributes of easy accessibility, less 
regulation , and l ower costs (Chanson, et al., 2018) . Traditionally, companies of  different sizes 
and developing stages need to target different fundraising strategies with a variety of intermediaries and  complex regulations. Revolutionar ily, an ICO offers a peer -to-peer 
fundraising process through globally distributed share offerings with nearly no regulations or  
intermediaries  (Chanson, et al., 2018) .  These unique features enable it to significantly simplify 24 
 the traditional fundraising process and allow it to contain any or all of the fundraising attributes  
included in IPO s, venture capital , crowdfunding, and so on (Tapscott and Tapscott, 2017) .  
However, innovation is always ac companied  by problems. The a ssociation between 
cryptocurrency and extensive criminal activities have been widely identified in the literature  
(Aldridge and Décary- Hétu, 2016; Foley, Karlsen, & Putniņš, 2019; Forgang, 2019) .  
Additionally , while  the unique features of ICO s as a fundraising process for companies to 
improve the  efficiency of the fundraising process , it has also made way for  massive scams. One 
of the key challenge s with ICOs and the issued tokens is that it is an emerging market where 
there are significant variances of quality between individual offerings, and there is an absence 
of a best practice framework to identify good quality from bad and an avoidance of any form 
of fiduciary responsibility and clarity  on consumer  protection  by issuers (Sehra, et al., 2017) . 
The Satis Crypto- Asset Market Coverage Initiation indicate d that over 80% of ICO fundraising 
activities were  scams, and only 4% of the total number of ICOs had succeeded in raising funds 
(Dowlat and Hodapp, 2018) .  
These problems  have pressured authorities acro ss the globe to take action in order to protect 
investors and  provide clarity, and this  eventually led to two significant drops i n the price of 
cryptocurrenc ies; one  at the end of 2017, and another at the beginning of 2018 (Moran, 2018) . 
The statistical result on CoinMarketCap1 indicates that the cryptocurrency market 
capitalisation has f allen by approximately 85% compare d to its peak value. T hese events have 
had a devastating impact upon the cryptocurrency market and have certainly made the  
fundraising and financing process of blockchain- related start -ups more difficult. Although the 
                                                 
1 CoinMarketCap. (2019). Global Chartes Total Market Capitalization. Retrieved Date  from 
https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/ . 
 25 
 total amount of funds raised  is increasing, the overall ICO success rate and fundraising for each 
project have  both been  reducing according to ICO Market Research report s on different 
quarters in 20181. 
5.1. Risk factors  
While cryptocurrency displays a great deal of potential, the way it has been treated as an 
investment has caused the market to lose confidence in its longevity in  the future. The 
continuing decline of cryptocurrency prices at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 made 
investors rethink the fundamental nature  of the market and its underlying issues, prompting the 
market to transform from a speculative bubble to a mature market.  
To put things into perspective, since its  peak at the end of 2017, the cryptocurrency market 
capitalisation has fallen b y approximately 85%, leading many to believe the market to be a 
purely speculative bubble and may be doomed to disappear in the future  (Zetzsche, et al., 2017) . 
Accordingly, we asked the survey participants to rank risk factors when it comes to mak ing 
decisions  about investment in cryptocurrency. As presented in Exhibit 5, there is a slight 
difference between  the Chinese and Australian survey.  For instance, Australian are far more 
concerned about face ICO and blockchain- based start -ups compared to Chinese investors.  
Interestingly, regulatory challenges are perceived with less risk among Chinese investors 
relative to Australians.  The regulatory challenges are largely relevant to  ICOs given that their 
regulatory classification can have profound impacts upon profit margins of investors, thereby 
affecting how well an ICO will perform. The l ack of ICO regulation has caused the market to 
lose confidence  in the legitimacy of ICOs, and the survey results confirm this statement.

Exhibit 5: statistics of risk factors  
5.2. ICO attributes  
Survey participants were  also asked about the importan ce of  ICO attributes in  investment 
decisions. As shown in  Exhibit 6, it turns out that there are a few differences between Australian 
and Chinese investors. For example, Australians highly value viability factors  such as having 
a long- term strategic plan, white paper, use -case, user -friendly interface, and regional scale 
when making decisions  to invest in an ICO. On the other hand, Chinese  individuals  highly 
value the type of platform but care  less about the regional scal ability and white paper. This may 
imply that in our sample, Australians are relatively long- term investors  as compared to the 
Chinese.

 5.3. Investment strat egy 
Respondents were also asked to reveal their investment strateg ies. As shown in Exhibit 7, 
the patterns are relatively similar among Australian and Chinese investors, with no changes 
and increasing across multiple cryptocurrencies as the major strateg ies.

the Australian and Chinese respondents. While the Chinese use relatively all means of trading, Australian respondents primarily use the online exchange platforms.

 cryptocurrency community meetup groups. Notably, while all surbey respondents are closely 
following the cryptocurrency news, some of them have not invested yet in the market. Hence, 
we asked this group about the main detterent reasons that have made them not to invest.  
Interestingly, there are differenc es between the Chinese and Australian responses due to 
different regulations in  the two countries, as shown  in Exhibit 9. The main reasons mentioned 
by Chinese f olks are lack of enough knowledge, volatility compared to fiat money, and failure 
stories. Meanwhile , the main factors for Australians are insufficient regulations , lack of enough 
information, concerns about trading, and uncertainty over the technology’s future .

6. Conclusion  
The results of  this research have produced findings relating to gender, income, age, 
occupation, investment experience, and further inferences. What is interesting about these 
initial findings is just how well they align with theories of risk -aversion in behavior al 
economics and finance.  Evidence suggests that less Australian females have invested in 0% 5% 10% 15% 20%Little knowledgeLittle knowledge about where I should buyBlurry future/ they are not real money and have not utilityPrices are not stableThere is insufficient regulation and legacy to support…I cannot sell/ exchange or spend it easilyI don't know which crypto it is worth investingI have seen/experienced some investment failures…I'm afraid of being involved in illegal actionOthersReasons not to invest

 cryptocurrency up to now  and are more  likely to  never invest or  invest  in the fut ure. Research 
in behavior al finance and economics suggests that where men tend to be more overconfident, 
women are much more cautious in situations of significant uncertainty. This could be one 
possible explanation of our findings given that the cryptocurr ency market has experienced 
significant fluctuation with a very blurry future given recent trends in pricing and regulation.  
As would be expected, income is also a significant determinant of cryptocurrency 
investment amongst Australian s, with those who have already invested in the market having 
incomes between 1000 and 2500 AUD per week.  This is i n line with behavior al research which 
says we become more risk tolerant as our income increases,  and it is also in line with  the nature 
of crypto which  allows people who have normally never invested beyond their superannuation 
to invest in something that gives them a chance to get “rich.”  
Amongst Chinese individuals , the probability of investing in cryptocurrency in creases for 
individuals belonging to the age group of 18-30 years old. This relationship is in line with 
biological scientists finding that the risk -seeking part of our brains physically changes as we 
age. It could also be linked with the fact that young people are more exposed and familiar wit h 
such disruptive technologies , or advocate the idea of replacing fiat money . The survey reveals 
that Chinese individuals who are older than  40 intend to invest in  the future , which may imply 
an increase  in the expendable income of this age group in China , thereby shifting their values.  
It seems that further knowledge about cryptocurrency and econom ics impacts the decision 
of investment as Australian  respondents  who have studied e conomics, business, or f inance are 
more likely to invest in the future, and having a postgraduate degree has been found to be a 
positive predictor of  cryptocurrency investment for Chinese  individuals . Through this analysis, 
it has also been found that Australians who have invested or intend to invest in  the 
cryptocurrency have jobs  in the banking and IT sector s. Those in banking could be expected to 
be interested in cryptocurrency investment as a reflection of how the sector thrives upon 31 
 financial innovation. Additionally, given the inherent expertise and resources those in IT may 
have over the general population, it is reasonable to expect that they may be more likely to 
exhibit interest in cryptocurrency investment. However, Australian business owners, entrepreneurs, and those who are employed in the education sector are less likel y to invest in 
cryptocurrency in the future. Furthermore, Chinese  individuals  who are employed in the 
wholesale sector are  unlikely to  invest in the cryptocurrency market.  
Australian s hare market investors are less likely to invest in cryptocurrency  in the future . 
This could be due to the market crash in 2017 caus ing them to sell or cut their losses which 
could have also led them to question the market’s fundamental value, potentially leading them to withdraw and continue investing in more established  markets.  
This study addressed another research question about the type of token investment, 
examining the characteristics of investors in coins  versus other types of tokens . Looking at the 
results, Australian investors at the age of 18 to 30 years old are m ore likely to invest in other 
startup ICOs compared to coins . However, high -income earners ( income higher than 2,500 
AUD per week), wholesalers, freelancers, casual workers, the unemployed, and those who have 
studied IT are more likely to invest in coins.  For Chinese investors, these parameters are 
slightly different with  being male , having previously invested in shares and fixed income , and 
freelancing as the significant , positive predictors for  in investing in coins.  
Despite the rapid growth of ICOs and s kyrocket ing cryptocurrency valuations, the market  
is yet  to reach a maturity level where it is feasible to be used by corporate funds  alongside  
individuals . According to Gartner, ICO s are on the peak of  a hype cycle  while cryptocurrencies 
are passing a trough of disillusionment. A significant issue within the market is irrational 
investor behavior . One example is herd mentality which occurs when individuals disregard 
private information in favour of a general consensus. Many other biases are evident, suc h as 32 
 overconfidence and the disposition effect, indicating the market to be filled with irrational 
decision- making, ultimately leading to an inefficient market with a poor pricing mechanism.  
Behavior al issues such as these could begin to be corrected by introducing professional 
investors to the market due to their experience in equity research. However, governments 
around the world have had different reactions to the innovative technology, with countries such 
as China outright banning cryptocurrency trade t hrough to countries like America which have 
begun applying similar regulations to cryptocurrency as they do to equities and other securities. 
Due to this global division and regulatory uncertainty, it is unlikely that institutional investors will enter the  market in any meaningful way in the near future. 
However, ICOs and cryptocurrency may become mainstream in  the future. Grounded on 
the concept of economy fragmentation which bitcoin advocated, it is important to study what other socio -demographic characte ristics and cryptocurrency attributes there are which may 
affect individuals (rather than corporate funds) to participate and invest in the market. Hence, 
this study can be further extended by incorporating latent variables  such as risk, social beliefs, 
and technology enthusiasm .
