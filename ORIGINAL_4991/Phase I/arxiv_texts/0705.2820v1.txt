Abstract
The author proposes a ﬁnance trading strategy named Entropy Ori-
ented Trading and apply thermodynamics on the strategy. The state
variables are chosen so that the strategy satisﬁes the secon d law of ther-
modynamics. Using the law, the author proves that the rate of investment
(ROI) of the strategy is equal to or more than the rate of price change.
1 Deﬁnition of the Strategy
An EntropyOriented Trading strategy has ntarget types of asset A0,···,An−1.
It has constant weights for the assets ( w0,w1,···,wn−1), where the weights are
positive and the sum of them is one. The price and the held amount of t heith
asset are written as piandhirespectively. The value of the ith asset is
Ui=pihi.
The total value of assets is
T=n−1/summationdisplay
i=0Ui.
The prices pichange according to time. On a point of time, a strategy can
trade assets AiandAj. It can change the held amounts ( hi,hj) to (h′
i,h′
j)
only if the total asset is not changed. We deﬁne the traded amount of value
Qij=pih′
i−pihiand express the trade condition
Qij+Qji= 0. (1)
Multiple trades may occur at the same time. In that case, the sum Qi=/summationtextn−1
j=0Qijis the value of the bought amount of the asset Ai. The value of Qiis
negative if asset Aiis sold.

1An Entropy Oriented Trading strategy tries to keep the distributio n of asset
equal to the weights, so in equilibrium, the equation (2) hold:
Ui=wiT. (2)
When the price change is slow enough (or the strategy trades freq uently
enough), the equation (2) holds. Otherwise, Ti=Ui/wican be diﬀerent from
T. In this case, the strategy trades to make all Ti’s equal.
We can assume that when Ti> Tj, an Entropy Oriented Trading strategy
does not trade selling Ajand buying Ai. This means
ifTi> Tj, Qij≤0. (3)
A trade involving AiandAjis reversible only if Ti=Tj.
2 Analysis of the Strategy
To analyse this strategy with thermodynamics, we have to choose t he state
variables and the equation of state. The state variables are pi,hi,Tiand the
equation of state is
wiTi=pihi (4)
and we take the internal energy as Ui=wiTi. Note that the T-based trading
restriction (3) is analogous to the second law of thermodynamics.
We ﬁrst analyse the case in which the equation (2) always holds and th en
analyse the more general case. In both cases, we assume that we can consider a
transformation of system as a continuous sequence of inﬁnitesima l transforma-
tions.
2.1 On Reversible Transformations
When the equation (2) always holds, Ti=Tjholds for any iandj, so that all
trades are reversible. The equation of state becomes
wiT=pihi. (5)
Taking the diﬀerential of (5), we have
widT=hidpi+pidhi.
The amount pidhi= d′Qiis the change of Uidue to the trades occurring at
the given point of time, whereas the amount hidpi=wiTdpi/piis the change
of the value of Uidue to the price change.
Integrating this from the state Cto the state Dyields:

We take an arbitary equilibrium state Oand deﬁne the entropy Si(C) as

where the integral is taken along a reversible transformation. We a lso deﬁne the
total entropy S(A) =/summationtextn−1
i=0Si(A).Note that the total entropy Sis constant in
reversible transformations.
2.2 On Irreversible Transformations
In irreversible transformations, the amount Tican be diﬀerent for diﬀerent i
because of delay of trades. Taking the diﬀerential of the equation of state (4)
yieldswidTi=pidhi+hidpi. Dividing this by Tand taking the integral from
a stateCto another state D, we get

We assume that the states CandDare in equilibrium so that for any i
Ti(C) =T(C) andTi(D) =T(D). We take summation for iand see

+(S(D)−S(C)). (7)
The trading restriction (3) means Qij/Ti+Qji/Tj≥0. From this we can
obtain ∆ S=S(D)−S(C)≥0. Especially, when a irreversible trade occurs
between AiandAj, the entropy increases by Qij/Ti+Qji/Tj>0.
The equation (7) states that the return of investment is the prod uct of the
rate of price change and exp(∆ S), which is equal to or more than one:
∆(lnT) = ∆(ln P)+∆S,where ∆ S≥0.
