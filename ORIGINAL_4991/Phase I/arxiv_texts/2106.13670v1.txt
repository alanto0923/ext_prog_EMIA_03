Abstract  
Sovereign wealth funds are created in those countries whose budget is highly dependent 
on market factors, usually world commodity prices. At the same time, these funds are large 
instit utional investors. An analysis of the nature of investments by the State Pension Fund Global 
of Norway showed that investments of the Fund are based on a seven -level model of diversifying 
its investments. This model can also be applied to the investments o f the National Wealth Fund 
of Russia to increase its profitability.

1. Introduction  
 
The dependence of a number of countries around the world on price fluctuations in global 
commodity markets has led to the need to create reserves or funds. Many countries in the world 
founded sovereign wealth funds. Thes e funds are used to maintain financial stability in times of 
crisis and as a tool for global investment. The main task of the sovereign wealth fund is to cover 
the budget deficit in the case of the adverse economic conditions or the accumulation of excess 
export earnings. These revenues can be invested in various projects, for example, in the 
construction of infrastructure, etc.  
 
2. Sovereign wealth funds around the world  
 
Since the creation of the first two sovereign wealth funds (Kuwaiti Inve stment Council, 
1953, and the Kiribati Reserve Revenue Balancing Fund, 1965), their number has increased 
significantly to about 70 funds. Sovereign wealth funds are established and operated in many 
countries around the world. As of June 2018 total assets o f the funds amounted to 7820 million 
dollars. [1]. Revenues from the export of commodities, mainly oil and oil products, are the basis 
for the formation of the assets of most of the funds in the world. In terms of assets, the three 
largest sovereign wealth  funds include the funds of Norway, China and the United Arab Emirates 
(Abu Dhabi). The National Welfare Fund of the Russian Federation ranks 18th in the world (se e 
Table 1) [1] .  
The objectives of the National Welfare Fund are to ensure the co -finan cing of voluntary 
pension savings of citizens of the Russian Federation and to ensure balance (deficit coverage) of 2 
 the budget of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation [2]. As of October 1, 2018 its assets 
amount to 5004.49 billion rubles (USD 76.3) o r 5.1% of GDP.  Linabourg -Maduell Index (Index 
in table 1) shows the transparency level.

     Sovereign funds have significant differences in their investment strategy and the 
degree of transparency and disclosure. Thus,  the foundations of Norway, Singapore, the United 
Arab Emirates and Australia have the highest index of transparency Linaburg -Maduell, the 
National Welfare Fund of the Russian Federation has an average value of this index of 5 (see 
Table 1). According to o ne of the leaders of Global Insight, Jan Randolph, sovereign funds are 
the newest leading force in the global financial market, which is replacing hedge funds and 
private investment funds [3].  
       
3.  Government pension fund of Norway  
 
    The Governmen t Pension Fund -Global of Norway was one of the most successful 
sovereign funds. 66.6 percent of the fund's assets were invested in the shares, 30.8 percent 
accounted for investments with fixed income (mainly bonds), 2.6 percent - for real estate. About 
40 percent of the fund's funds are accounted for by government funding, the rest was obtained 
through successful investments.  
    In 2017, it earned more than one trillion kronor (US $ 131.5 billion at the current 
exchange rate) from investments. The yield on  the fund's investments was 13.7 percent, 
according to data from the annual report published on February 27. On average for all time 
investments since 1998, the yield was 6.1 percent. In 2016, the yield was 7 percent [4].  
     The most successful were inv estments in stocks. The yield on these securities 
amounted to 19.4 percent in 2017. The most profitable were shares of technology companies. On 
them, the fund earned 32.4 percent of income from invested funds. Investments in stocks of 
companies producing b asic materials showed a yield of 27.1 percent.  
      Investments in metallurgy and chemical industry turned out to be the most profitable. 
The rise in prices for metals and chemical compounds was due to steady demand, combined with 
a reduction in productio n capacity in China.  
      A good result also brought investment in real estate - 7.5 percent yield. Bonds, as a 
less risky instrument, showed a low yield of 3.3 percent. The capitalization of the fund by the 
end of 2017 amounted to 8.488 trillion kronor ( 1.085 trillion dollars).  
       The Governmental Pension Fund Global Norway has the following seven levels of 
diversification of investments of financial resources: 1) stocks and bonds; 2) regions (Europe, 
America, Asia / Oceania); 3) currencies; 4) countr ies; 5) industries; 6) companies / 
organizations; 7) corporate / non -corporate issuers.  
- the first level is investment in stocks and bonds. Preference is given to bonds (about 
60% of the portfolio) as the most stable and reliable securities. The fund adh eres to the statutory 
ratios between stocks (30 –50%) and bonds (70 –50%).  
- the second level represents investments by region (Europe, America, Asia and Oceania). 
Here the advantage is given to Europe as the most dynamically developing region, which is in 4 
 close proximity to Norway. Legislatively are established the limits on the investment of shares 
and bonds by region.  
- the third level is investment in currencies. The fund invests in  various currencies, and 
then conducts final settlements in Norwegian kronas. Recalculation into a single currency is very 
important, since the profitability of the GPF differs, when it is expressed in different currencies.  
- the fourth level is the invest ment by country, with the priority belongs to the countries 
of Europe. For investments in stocks and bonds, various lists of countries where the financial 
resources of the fund are invested are separately established.  
- the fifth level  is investment by in dustry. It has the advantage of financial and banking 
sector, energy enterprises, consumer goods, telecommunications and communications.  
- the sixth level is the investment in securities of companies -issuers. It is accepted that the 
amount of investment in  each individual company may not exceed 3% of its voting shares or 
share capital.  
- the seventh level is the investment by type of issuer of securities (corporate / 
unincorporated securities). It is present only in investments in bonds, since all investmen ts in 
stocks are related to corporate securities.  
    The revenues of the fund portfolio are calculated according to market prices. The State 
Bank of Norway checks the market value of a portfolio and calculates weighted average return 
only at the end of t he month. For this, the method of weighted average monetary valuation 
(modified Ditz method) is used, which is determined using the special formula:  
 (1) 
where RM is the weighted average cash income for the period,%;  
       MVB and MVE - portfolio value, respectively, at the beginning and at the end of the 
period;  
        T - numbers of days of the period;  
        i - numbers of days attributable to cash flow Ki;  
        Ki is the value of the cash flow on the i -th day.  
 
4. National Wealth  Fund of Russ ia 
The National Wealth Fund is part of the federal budget of the Russian Federation. The 
fund is intended to be part of a sustainable mechanism for providing pensions to citizens of the 
Russian Federation for the long term. The objectives of the National W elfare Fund are to ensure 
the co -financing of voluntary pension savings of citizens of the Russian Federation and to ensure 
balance (deficit coverage) of the budget of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation [2].  
From January to November 2018, the Natio nal Wealth Fund increased by 1,219 billion 
rubles. The fund grew 5 months out of 11 and reached its maximum size in a year in September, 
when it rose to 3,699 billion rubles. The dynami cs of the Fund  is presented in Table 2.

according to bank account agreement; 2)purchase of foreign currencies and financial assets 
denominated in  Russian ruble and eligible foreign currencies (further – eligible financial assets)

5.  Conclusion  
The analysis of the main characteristics of the Government Pension Fund -Global of 
Norway showed, that the return on the portfolio in% per month is calculat ed based on the 
distribution of cash flows at the initial and final points in time.  
Norway's experience in investing the assets of the sovereign fund may be useful in 
Russia. In particular, the fund of the Russia can also be invested in securities, taking into account 
several levels of diversification in order to accumulate higher profitability.
