This paper conducts an empirically study on the trade package comp osed of a sequence of
consecutive purchases or sales of 23 stocks in Chinese stock mark et. We investigate the prob-
ability distributions of the execution time, the number of trades and the total trading volume
of trade packages, and analyze the possible scaling relations betwe en them. Quantitative dif-
ferences are observed between the institutional and individual inv estors. The trading proﬁle
of trade packages is investigated to reveal the preference of lar ge trades on trading volumes
and transaction time of the day, and the diﬀerent proﬁles of two ty pes of investors imply that
institutions may be more informed than individuals. We further analyz e the price impacts
of both the entire trade packages and the individual transactions inside trade packages. We
ﬁnd the price impact of trade packages is nonnegligible over the perio d of the execution time
and it may have a power-law relation with the total trading volume. Th e price impact of the
transactions inside trade packages displays a U-shaped proﬁle with respect to the time tof the
day, and also shows a power-law dependence on their trading volume s. The trading volumes of
the transactions inside trade packages made by institutions have a stronger impact on current
returns, but the following price reversalspersist overa relatively s horter horizonin comparison
with those by individuals.

1. Introduction
The study of price impact of trading on stock exchanges is kno wn as one of the central topics in
ﬁnancial economics. It has been veriﬁed by many empirical st udies that large trades generally
have a strong impact on stock price (Ying 1966, Karpoﬀ 1987, W oodet al.1985, Gallant et al.
1992, Chan and Fong 2000, Lillo et al.2003, Lim and Coggins 2005, Næs and Skjeltorp 2006,
Zhou 2011). The single execution of a large order will lead to a large impact on stock price
and increase the investor’s cost. Therefore, large orders a re usually split into small pieces,
and executed at an extended period of time to minimize their p rice impact. These sequences
of trades are called trade packages (Chan and Lakonishok 199 5, Gallagher and Looi 2006,
Giambona and Golec 2010), hidden orders (Vaglica et al.2008, Moro et al.2009, Vaglica et al.
2010), or metaorders (Farmer et al.2011). Growing evidence shows that large trades play a ma-
jor role in trading in stock markets, which represent a large fraction of market’s total trading
volume (Keim and Madhavan 1996, Jain 2003, Prino et al.2007, Gregoriou 2008, Vaglica et al.
2010).
A large amount of research has been conducted on the large tra des of institutional investors,
most of which consider the individual trade as the basis unit of analysis in the study of its price
impact (Keim and Madhavan 1996, Prino et al.2007, Gregoriou 2008, Kraus and Stoll 1972,
Aitken and Frino 1996, Gemmill 1996, Saar 2001, Chiyachanta naet al.2004). However, an in-
stitutional order is often broken up into a sequence of conse cutive trades, and its total volume
occupies a large fraction of the stock’s trading volume. The refore, it may be better to treat the
sequence of trades as the basis unit of analysis in the study o f institutional trades. The earli-
est study of trade packages may be traced back to the study by C han and Lakonishok (1995).
They analyze the price impact of the entire sequence of trade s in Now York and American
Stock Exchanges, and ﬁnd that the price impact is related to p ackage size and trade complex-
ity. Gallagher and Looi (2006) study the abnormal returns fo r trade packages of the Australian
equity managers to estimate their trade performance. Giamb ona and Golec (2010) study the
wrong trades inside trade packages by large intuitional ins ider. Recently, Vaglica et al.(2008),
Moroet al.(2009), and Vaglica et al.(2010) try to study the market impact of trade packages
identiﬁed by the continuous increase or decrease of a ﬁrm’s s tock inventory. Farmer et al.(2011)
propose a theoretical model to study the permanent impact of large trading orders. The appli-
cation of such research lies in the study of optimal executio n of large orders to minimize the
trading costs of institutional investors (Almgren 2003, Ob izhaeva and Wang 2010, Alfonsi et al.
2010).
Many articles have addressed the question of how to measure t he price impact of trade pack-
ages. Chan and Lakonishok (1995) study the price impact duri ng trade packages using the av-
erage, open and close price on the ﬁrst and last day of the trad e package. Following their
works, Gallagher and Looi (2006) measure the impact over an e xtended period of time before
the start and after the end of the package. Instead, Vaglica et al.(2008), Moro et al.(2009),
and Vaglica et al.(2010) study the price impact of trade packages using the tra nsaction data,
measuredas thediﬀerencebetween thepricesof theﬁstandlas t transaction of thetradepackage.
In this paper, we are not only interested in the market impact of the entire trade package, but
also concerned about the impact of the individual transacti ons inside packages. For the study of
price impact of isolated large trades, an early study measur es the price impact using the close
price a few days before and after the trades (Kraus and Stoll 1 972). Keim and Madhavan (1996)
use the close price on the trading day prior to and after block trades. In stead of using the close
price,recentstudieschoosethetransactionpricetoestim atethepriceimpactofindividualtrades,
e.g., the average price of several transactions prior to and after block trades (Prino et al.2007,
Gemmill 1996), or the transaction price immediately prior t o and after block trades (GregoriouAugust 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3
LATEX2εguide for authors 3
2008).
To the best of our knowledge, the empirical study on trade pac kages in Chinese stock market
has not been conducted. This may due to the diﬃculty of collec tion of proprietary data. We
have the ultrahigh-frequency data of 23 liquid stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in year
2003. The data contain the information about all the transac tions of each investor, including the
trading price, the trading volume, the transaction time, et c. We use the trading records of the
23 stocks as our sample data, and analyze the price impact of t rade packages and the individual
transactions inside using the transaction price.
Unlike the data provided by the Plexus Group (Keim and Madhav an 1995,
Chiyachantana et al.2004), we are not directly informed of the large institution al trades
from our database. Proxy methods are used to detect the trade packages, for instance, a
technical detection algorithm based on the inventory time e volution of ﬁrms (Vaglica et al.
2008, Moro et al.2009, Vaglica et al.2010). In the present work, we follow the ideal introduced
in Chan and Lakonishok (1995), Gallagher and Looi (2006) and Giambona and Golec (2010),
and deﬁne the trade package as a sequence of mostly buy or sell trades with less than a n-day
break between chronologically adjacent trades. Consisten t with the results revealed in previous
studies, we observe similar results for various length of br eakn= 1,5,10 days, other than some
quantitative diﬀerences.
So far, previous studies of trade packages primarily focus o n the large trades made by insti-
tutional investors. Our database includes the trading reco rds for both institutional and indi-
vidual investors, identiﬁed by a particular code denoting t he investor type. Large trades made
by individuals, e.g., private equity investments, can also be detected using the same detection
rules. Therefore, we can also study the price impact of large individual trading. In addition,
our present study further conﬁrms the nonlinear power-law r elation between the price returns
and trading volumes, as revealed in many empirical studies ( Hasbrouck 1991, Plerou et al.2002,
Chordia and Subrahmanyam 2004, Zhou 2011). Another purpose is to study the price impact
of individual transactions inside trade packages. We ﬁnd th at the individual transactions have
a strong positive impact on the current price and a temporary negative impact on the following
prices, though the cumulative impact of the entire trade pac kage is nonnegligible over the whole
period of execution time.
The remainder paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our database, the
investigated variables of trade packages and their summary statistics. Sections 3 studies the
statistic properties of trade packages, including the prob ability distributions of the investigated
variables and their scaling relations. In Section 4, we atte mpt to study the trading proﬁle of
trade packages by analyzing the mean trading volume, transa ction probability and the total
trading volume with respect to the time of a day. The price imp acts of the entire trade packages
and the individual transactions inside trade packages are c arefully studied in Section 6. Section
7 summarizes our ﬁndings.
2. Data and investigated variables
2.1. Data sample
The data used in our study comprise 23 liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange
(SZSE), one of the two stock exchanges in mainland China. The SZSE was established on De-
cember 1, 1990 and started its operations on July 3, 1991. The SZSE has two separate markets
including A-shares and B-shares. A-shares are common stock s issued by mainland Chinese com-
panies, subscribed and traded in Chinese currency Renminbi (RMB), purchased and sold byAugust 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3
4 Fei Ren and Wei-Xing Zhou
Chinese nationals and approved foreign investors. The A-sh are market was launched in 1990
and opened only to domestic investors before 2003. B-shares are also issued by mainland Chi-
nese companies, but traded in foreign currencies. B-shares carry a face value denominated in
RMB. The B-share Market was launched in 1992 and was restrict ed to foreign investors before
February 19, 2001. It has been opened to Chinese investors si nce then.
We mainly study the data of 23 stocks in A-share market of the S ZSE in year 2003. Up
to the end of 2003, there have been 491 A-share stocks listed o n the SZSE. The total market
capitalization ofA-sharemarketwas1.2billionRMBandthe ﬂoatmarket capitalization was0.45
billion RMB. Our sample stocks were part of the 40 constituen t stocks composing the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange Component Index in 2003. These 23 stocks are r epresentative in a variety of
industry sectors, as shown in Table 1. The total transaction amountAtot, the ﬂoat capitalization
Cfloand the total market capitalization Ctot, in unit of million RMB, of 23 stocks in year 2003
are also listed in Table 1. For instance, the total transacti on amount Atotof stock 000001 in 2003
is 23847.6 million RMB, and the ﬂoat capitalization Cfloand total market capitalization Ctotof
the same stock are 12 and 16.6 million RMB respectively. The Atotis three orders of magnitude
larger than CfloandCtot. Similar phenomenon are observed in all the 23 stocks, which implies
that the average transaction amount per day of a certain stoc k almost approximates to its total
market capitalization. This indicates that the market was r elatively active in 2003, though it
was in the middle of a ﬁve-year bear market (Zhou and Sornette 2004).
The SZSE generally opens from Monday to Friday, but closes fo r public holidays and other
dates as announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commi ssion. We mainly consider the
continuous double auction operates from 9:30 to 11:30 and 13 :00 to 15:00. Based upon the orders
of submission and cancelation, the transaction is automati cally executed according to price-time
priority matching rule. The trading records of 23 stocks are consequently extracting from the
original database of order ﬂows. It is worthwhile to point ou t that the account number for
each investor is provided under the condition that the name o f the investor involved is removed
from the data. Therefore, we can obtain the sequence of trans actions for each investor, which
contains the information about the trade price, the trading volume, and the transaction time.
We treat those transactions executed by a certain investor a t the same time but traded with
diﬀerent investors as one trade for this investor. Moreover, in our database each market member
is endowed with a code identifying the investor type, i.e., i nstitution and individual. That makes
it possible to compare the trading dynamics between those tw o types of investors.
Table 1 presents summary statistics of the trading records o f 23 stocks, including the number
of investors Ninv, the total number of trades Ntra, the mean, median and standard deviation of
the number of trades per investor. The number of investors Ninvvaries in the range from 34814
(stock 000720) to 533752 (stock 000001), and the total numbe r of trades Ntravaries in the range
from 194644 (stock 000541) to 2925841 (stock 000001). We int egrate the trading records of the
23 stocks, and the sample size is 18597649 trades in total. Fo r most of the stocks analyzed in
our study, the mean number of trades for each investor is arou nd 5, and the median is slightly
smaller, about 2 or 3. The standard deviation of the number of trades per investor ﬂuctuates in
a wide range between 9.3 and 35.4, and the large values of the s tandard deviation indicate big
diﬀerences between the trades number of diﬀerent investors.
2.2. Identiﬁcation of trade packages
The trade package is deﬁned as a sequence of mostly buy (sell) trades of a stock, and it is
generally ended by a speciﬁc break time between chronologic ally adjacent trades. The selection
of the break time does not sensitively aﬀect the results, only brings a quantitative diﬀerence.

asset management company, and they ﬁnd that the package grou pings are not sensitive to the
length of the break. In fact, there is no much diﬀerence observ ed for the break length longer
than 5 days, as shown in the following context. In this paper, we present the results of trade
packages ended by the break of 1,5,10 days separately.
Denotevias the trading volume of a certain transaction iinside a trade package, we consider
the trade package consisted mostly of purchases or sales, i. e.,/summationtext
buyvi/summationtextvi> θor/summationtext
sellvi/summationtextvi> θ. The
parameter θis set to be 0 .75 in the present study. For other values θ >0.75 we observe similar
results,consistent withtheresultsfoundbyVaglica et al.(2008). Theinvestors, whooccasionally
trade in stock market, may have packages containing very few trades which also satisfy the above
condition. To avoid considering those investors who are unl ikely to split their trades, we choose
relatively active investors and restrict the packages with Nm>5, where Nmis the number of
trades done through market orders. Market orders are submit ted by investors who are urgent
to trade, and are executed immediately after the submission . Those orders waited in the limit
order book and executed later are limit orders. The threshol d 5 is close to the mean number
of trades per investor shown in Table 1. If a package of trades hasNmlarger than the mean
number of trades per investor, we regard it to be a trade packa ge made by an active investor.
Following the detecting rules: (i) packages are separated b y a n-day break, (ii) at least 75%
of the trading volumes in the package are buying or selling vo lumes, (iii) the number of trades
executed as market orders in the package should be larger tha n 5, we ﬁnd out the trade packages
of 23 stocks. We integrate the package samples over all the 23 stocks. As shown in Table 2, there
are 1187, 1066, 923 trade packages made by institutions dete cted for the break of 1, 5, 10 days.August 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3
6 Fei Ren and Wei-Xing Zhou
For individuals, the number of trade packages detected is la rger, 35187, 37924, 35319 for the
break of 1, 5, 10 days. This may because that the number of indi vidual investors is much larger
than the number of institutional investors. There are 32152 46 individuals and 67054 institutions
tradedin the 23 stocks in year 2003. Thismay also beexplaine d by their diﬀerent ways of trading
in stock market. Institutions trade strictly following the ir trading strategies, and they do not
trade as frequently as individuals.
The variables characterizing the trade packages are deﬁned as following: (i) The execution
timeTof the trade package, measured as the interval between the ﬁr st and last transaction of
the trade package, in unit of one second. (ii) The number of tr adesNwithin the trade package.
(iii) The total trading volume of the trade package, denoted asV=/summationtextN
i=1vi.
Table 2 gives the means of the execution time, the number of tr ades and the total trading
volumes for both institutions and individuals. The mean of t he execution time /angbracketleftT/angbracketrightshows an
increasing tendency as the increase of the break time separa ting packages. It is 5973, 57259,
113779 seconds for institutions, and 5553, 58701, 117811 se conds for individuals for the break of
1, 5, 10 days. The mean of the number of trades /angbracketleftN/angbracketrightfor institutions is 41, 54, 56 for the break of
1, 5, 10 days, larger than 32, 35, 36 those for individuals. Si milarly, the mean of the total trading
volumes /angbracketleftV/angbracketrightfor institutions is 177311, 224872, 236013 for the break of 1 , 5, 10 days, larger than
121841, 124456, 124004 those for individuals. This implies the institutions have capitalization
on average larger than individuals, and need more transacti ons to accomplish the purchase or
sale of large amounts of shares. In general, a trade package c onsists of a sequence of 30 −60
consecutive transactions, and each transaction on average has 4000 shares. Therefore, the trade
packages analyzed in our study are of extremely large size.
3. Statistics properties of trade packages
3.1. Probability distributions of variables characterizing trade p ackages
Vaglicaet al.(2008) study three most capitalized stocks traded on the Spa nish Stock Exchange
(BME), and reveal that the probability distribution functi ons (PDFs) of the variables T,Nand
Vhave power-law tails with exponents lying in an interval [1 .2,2.3]. An extended study of 23
stocks on BME and 74 stocks on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) further conﬁrms this result
(Moroet al.2009). We pool together the data from 23 stocks on the SZSE, an d investigate the
PDFs of T,NandVfor trade packages ended by the break of 1,5,10 days. Power-l aw tails
are observed in the PDFs of these variables. For a variable xwhich obeys a power-law tail
distribution, we suppose its PDF follows a formula
P(x) =cx−δ, x≥xmin. (1)
Weﬁrstcalculate thePDFoftheexecution time T.NotethePDFisdiﬀerentfordiﬀerenttypes

and 1(b), P(T) of trade packages ended by the break of 1,5,10 days for both i nstitutions and
individuals are plotted. The PDFs seem to have power-law tai ls, and we ﬁt them using a power-

As shown in Figure 1(a), P(T) for institutions displays power-law tails covering a scal ing
range over two orders of magnitude, and the exponent δTvaries with diﬀerent break length. For
the break of one day, δTis estimated to be 0 .3, while for the break longer than ﬁve days δTis
relatively constant and is around 0 .8. In the ﬁgure, the power-law ﬁts with parameters listed in
Table 2 are also illustrated. For individuals, we observe si milar results, and the estimated values
ofδTare slightly larger than those for the institution, as depic ted in Table 2.

2.4, displaying a value very close to that for the break longer t han ﬁve days, while for individuals
δVfor the break of one day is 3 .2 larger than 2 .7 that for the break longer than ﬁve days. The
power-law ﬁts of P(V) with parameters listed in Table 2 are also illustrated in th e ﬁgure.
3.2. Scaling relations between variables characterizing trade packages
Empirical studies have revealed that there exist scaling re lations between variables T,NandV
T∼Vg1, N∼Vg2, T∼Ng3. (10)
It is found g1≃2,g2≃1, andg3≃1.7 for BME and LSE markets (Moro et al.2009). We
also ﬁnd that T,NandVof the trade packages for SZSE are related through scaling re lations,
but with diﬀerent values of g1,g2andg3, primarily due to the small value of the exponent δT.
Since the exponents δT,δNandδVdiﬀer for the two types of investors, we calculate the scaling
relations for institutions and individuals respectively.
We study the scaling relation between TandVby calculating the mean conditional execution
time/angbracketleftT|V/angbracketrightconditioned on the total trading volume V. We arrange the entire Tsequences in
ascending order, and partition it to 20 bins with equal size. We calculate /angbracketleftT|V/angbracketrightconditioned on a
bin ofVto get better statistics. In Figure 2(a), /angbracketleftT|V/angbracketrightfor trade packages of institutions ended by
the break of one day is plotted. For large scales of V, one observes a scaling relation between T
andV, andg1is estimated tobe0 .18. This is consistent with thepreviousresultthat P(V) obeysAugust 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3

power law for large V. We also study the scaling relations between NandV,TandNusing
the same method, and obtain g2= 0.74 andg3= 0.18 as illustrated in Figures 2(b) and 2(c).
For trade packages of individuals ended by the break of one da y, we obtain g1= 0.13,g2= 0.72
andg3= 0.16, slightly smaller than those for institutions, as shown i n Figures 2(d), 2(e) and
2(f). Similar results are observed for trade packages of bot h institutions and individuals ended
by the break longer than ﬁve days. According to the scaling re lations in Equation (10), one can
infer the relation that g1=g2g3. The estimated values of g1,g2andg3depicted in Table 2 prove
the inferred relation between them.
4. Trading proﬁle
We further consider the question of how the individual trans actions inside trade packages are
executed as a function of the time tof a day, which is called trading proﬁle. We are mainly
concerned about the trade packages ﬁnished within one day, i .e., packages ended by the break of
one day, and the time tis normalized by the time of a trading day D= 14400 seconds. Denote
vias the trading volume of transaction iinside trade packages, we calculate the mean volume of
each transaction /angbracketleftv(t)/angbracketrighttraded at normalized time t/D. To make the trading volumes of diﬀerent
stocks comparable, viof a particular stock is normalized by its mean value.
In Figures 3(a) and 3(b), the mean trading volume /angbracketleftv(t)/angbracketrightof individual transactions inside
trade packages is plotted as a function of the normalized tim et/Dfor institutions and individ-August 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3

uals respectively. Since the mean trading volume may diﬀer fo r the transactions with diﬀerent
aggressiveness, we calculate /angbracketleftv(t)/angbracketrightof the transactions executed as market orders (ﬁlled black
circles) and limit orders (empty black circles). One observ es that institutions prefer to place
large market orders close to the opening time, while individ uals are more likely to place large
market orders close to the closing time of the day. Moreover, /angbracketleftv(t)/angbracketrightof market orders is much
more signiﬁcant than that of limit orders, which indicates t hat the trade packages are accom-
plished mostly by market orders. Therefore, /angbracketleftv(t)/angbracketrightof the total market orders and limit orders
(black squares) shows a similar proﬁle to that of the market o rders. The mean trading volume
of the transactions concurrently traded with trade package s (red diamonds) also has a similar
proﬁle, slightly larger than that for the total market order s and limit orders, diﬀerent from that
observed in BME and LSE markets (Clauset et al.2009). These results are quite robustfor trade
packages of both institutions and individuals.
To complectly understand the trading proﬁle, we further con sider the number of transactions
executed at time t. We calculate the probability distribution P(t) of the transaction time t,
deﬁned as the proportion between number of transactions tra ded at time tto the total number
of transactions inside trade packages. As shown in Figure 3( c),P(t) for institutions is relatively
small close to the opening time of the day. It may be explained by the phenomena that the
mean volume of individual transactions is signiﬁcant large then, and only a few numbers of
transactions could accomplish the purchase or sale of large amounts of shares. There is a midday
break during the lunch time in Chinese stock market, and the s urge ofP(t) soon after midday
break may be caused by the entrance of many institutions who s tart trade packages in the
afternoon. An increase of P(t) is also observed close to the closing time of the day, this ma y
because that all the trade packages within one day should be a ccomplished at that time. The
probability distribution P(t) for individuals shows a similar proﬁle to that for institut ions. We
also measure the probability distribution of the initial an d ﬁnal time of trade packages. As
shown in Figures 3(e) and 3(f), for both institutions and ind ividuals a signiﬁcant fraction of
trade packages are started at the opening time and ﬁnished at the closing time. Moreover, there
are quite a number of trade packages start after the midday br eak, and this may explain the
surge of P(t) soon after the midday break.
We ﬁnally investigate the total trading volume of individua l transactions inside trade packages
traded at time t, i.e., the product of the mean volume of individual transact ions and the number
of transactions. In Figures 3(g) and 3(h), the total trading volume/summationtextv(t) of transactions inside
trade packages is plotted with respect to time tfor institutions and individuals respectively.
For the opening hours in the morning,/summationtextv(t) for institutions shows a maximum at around 0 .1
day (approximately at 10:00), about half hour earlier than t he location of the maximum for
individuals. After the midday break,/summationtextv(t) for institutions shows a rapid increase and exhibits
a maximum at round 0 .65 day (approximately at 13:30), while no such peak is observ ed for
individuals. Large/summationtextv(t) is further observed close to the closing time for both insti tutions and
individuals. The fact that institutions start their trade p ackages earlier than individuals implies
institutions may be more informed than individuals.
5. Price impact
5.1. Price impact of trade packages
The price impact is a very important issue in ﬁnancial studie s, and a large number of studies
have focused attention on this topic. In this section, we ﬁrs t consider the price impact of trade
packages, generally measured as the diﬀerence between the pr ice prior and after the trade pack-August 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3

age (Chan and Lakonishok 1995, Gallagher and Looi 2006). For a trade package accomplished
between time tandt+T, we follow the work by Moro et al.(2009), and deﬁne the price impact
as the diﬀerence between the logarithmic price of the ﬁrst and last transaction of the trade
package
r= lnp(t+T)−lnp(t). (11)
The scaled price impact is obtained by taking into account th e normalization condition and the
sign of the trade package

the nonsuccessive trades overnight. In Figures 4(a) and 4(b ), the mean conditional scaled price
impact/angbracketleftR|T/angbracketrightis plotted as a function of the execution time Tfor institutions and individuals
respectively. A trade package can be accomplished with diﬀer ent component of market orders
and limit orders. To identify it, we calculate the variable Fmdeﬁned as the fraction of volumes
done through market orders within trade packages. The mean c onditional price impact /angbracketleftR|T/angbracketright
for trade packages with large and small fraction of market or ders, i.e., Fm>0.8 andFm<0.2,
are represented separately in the ﬁgure.
Despiteofstrongﬂuctuationintheconditional priceimpac t,themeanconditional priceimpact
/angbracketleftR|T/angbracketrightwithFm>0.8 is mostly positive over the whole range of Tfor both institutions and
individuals. This indicates that the trade package has a non negligible price impact over the
whole range of execution time up to one day. The cumulative eﬀe ct of a sequence of mostly
buyer-initiated trades is more like to raise the price, whil e the cumulative eﬀect of a sequence of
mostly seller-initiated trades is more likely to reducethe price. Moreover, /angbracketleftR|T/angbracketrightwithFm<0.2 is
mostly negative, and this implies that the price impact of a t rade packages is not dominated by
the sign of the most trades when there is a low fraction of mark et orders. We further perform the
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test if the means of the condi tional price impact for diﬀerent
Tare equal. For institutions, we obtain a p-value 0.919 for trade packages with Fm>0.8, and
ap-value 0.787 for trade packages with Fm<0.2. Similar large p-values are observed for trade
packages of individuals, which indicates that /angbracketleftR|T/angbracketrightdoes not have much diﬀerence for various T.
No clear tendency of /angbracketleftR|T/angbracketrightis observed in our study.

previous ﬁnding that the cumulative impact of a trade packag e is dominated by the sign of the
most trades when there is a large fraction of market orders. W e also use the ANOVA to compare
the means of the conditional price impact for diﬀerent V, and ﬁnd very small p-values for trade

studies, we assume the absolute /angbracketleftR|V/angbracketrightfor large Vfollows a power law
|/angbracketleftR|V/angbracketright|=AVγ. (13)
The power-law ﬁts with estimated parameters Aandγlisted in Table 3 are illustrated in Fig-
ures 4(c) and 4(d). For trade packages with Fm>0.8,γis about 0.447 for institutions, and
0.295 for individuals. The exponent γfor trade packages with Fm<0.2 is slightly larger. The
power-law increase of /angbracketleftR|V/angbracketrightat large scales of Vmay correspond to the purchase or sale of large
amounts of shares with the motive to adjust share inventory. However, /angbracketleftR|V/angbracketrightfor trade packages
of institutions with Fm>0.8 does not increase monotonously with the increase of V. The vari-
able/angbracketleftR|V/angbracketrightshows a decreasing tendency with increasing VwhenVis small. This indicates that
small trading volumes may also cause large price changes, an d it may refer to the purchase or
sale of small amounts of shares for the purpose of stock price adjustment.
5.2. Instantaneous price impact of transactions inside trade packages
We have shown the price impact of the entire trade packages, a nd then we investigate the
price impact of individual transactions inside trade packa ges. Given a transaction iinside trade

5.2.1. Rivst
We measure the mean conditional scaled price impact /angbracketleftRi|t/angbracketrightof individual transactions con-
ditioned on the time t. In Figures 5(a) and 5(b), /angbracketleftRi|t/angbracketrightis plotted as a function of the time t
for institutions and individuals respectively. The mean co nditional scaled price impact of the
transactions executed as market orders and limit orders are represented by black circles and red
squares in the ﬁgure. For market orders, /angbracketleftRi|t/angbracketrightdisplays a concave U-shaped proﬁle. Though the
error bar is quite large, /angbracketleftRi|t/angbracketrightfor market orders is mostly positive. For limit orders, /angbracketleftRi|t/angbracketrightis
mostly negative, and displays an inverted U-shaped proﬁle. The sign of /angbracketleftRi|t/angbracketrightindicates that the
direction of the price change is driven by the market order. I n other words, the buyer-initiated
trades raise the price, and the seller-initiated trades red uce the price. Moreover, the U-shaped
and inverted U-shaped proﬁles imply that the price impact cl ose to the opening and closing time
is larger than the price impact during the remainder of the da y. We also investigate the price
impact of the transactions concurrently traded with those t ransactions inside trade packages

the direction of the price change as observed in /angbracketleftRi|t/angbracketright. Similar to /angbracketleftR|V/angbracketrightfor trade packages, the
absolute /angbracketleftRi|v/angbracketrightof transactions inside trade packages follows a power law

whenvis large enough v >103. Theestimated parameters Bandkforthepower-law ﬁt of /angbracketleftRi|v/angbracketright
are listed in Table 4. The exponent kfor transactions executed as market orders is larger than
that for transactions executed as limit orders, which indic ates that for the isolated transactions
inside trade packages the price impact is remarkably aﬀected by the market order. However, the
cumulative impact of trade packages with small fraction of m arket orders is comparable with the
cumulative impact of trade packages with large fraction of m arket orders. In fact, the exponent
γof/angbracketleftR|V/angbracketrightfor packages with Fm<0.2 is slightly larger than that for packages with Fm>0.8.
This may because the investors use diﬀerent strategies for th e accomplishment of trade packages.
Like a sequence of mostly buyer-initiated trades, a sequenc e of sales mostly executed as limit
orders can also raise the price, aﬀected by the buyer-initiat ed trades on the opposite sides.August 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3

5.3. Temporary price impact of transactions inside trade packages
5.3.1. Impact of trading volumes on current and following pr ice returns
Numerous studies have focused on the inﬂuence of trading vol umes or volume imbalances
on price returns (Wood et al.1985, Karpoﬀ 1987, Gallant et al.1992, Saatcioglu and Starks
1998, Lillo et al.2003, Plerou et al.2002, Chordia and Subrahmanyam 2004). We analyze the
temporary impact of transactions inside trade packages in r elation to their trading volumes.
Suppose r(t) = lnp(t)−lnp(t−1) is the price return at time t,v(t) is the trading volume of a
transaction inside trade package traded at time t. The returns of a certain stock are normalized
by its standard deviation. To explain the inﬂuence of the tra ding volume at time ton the price
return at later time t+i, we estimate a regression of the following form
R(t+i) =β∗
0+βislnv(t)+ǫ(t), (18)
wheresis the sign of the transaction. We measure the impact of the tr ading volumes v(t) within
tradepackage on thecurrent pricereturn i= 0 andthe following pricereturns i= 5,10,15,20,25
seconds. It has been empirically veriﬁed that the price retu rn has a power-law dependenceon the
trading volume (Hasbrouck 1991, Plerou et al.2002, Chordia and Subrahmanyam 2004, Zhou
2011), also conﬁrmed in the measure of /angbracketleftRi|v/angbracketright. The ﬁrst-order approximation of the logarithmic
return is assumed, and a linear regression of the return agai nst logarithmic trading volume is
used to approximate their power-law relations.
Table 5 reports the estimated coeﬃcients of regressions usi ng the records of transactions
inside trade packages executed as market orders from instit utions. Positive coeﬃcient β0secis
observed in all the 23 stocks, which further conﬁrms the ﬁndi ng that the sign of price return is
determined by the sign of the market order as revealed in the m easure of /angbracketleftRi|t/angbracketright. The relevant
t-statistics are also depicted in Table 5. Theimpact of tradi ng volume on the current pricereturn
is signiﬁcant for most of stocks except for stocks 000009 ,000012,000429,000550. This indicates
that the instantaneous impact of the trading volumes execut ed as market orders is positive and
signiﬁcant. We ﬁnd the price tends to reverse soon after the t ransaction inside trade package,
showing negative βiwithi >0. This reminds us of the signiﬁcant price reversal after lar ge
price changes (Zawadowski et al.2004, Mu et al.2010). The magnitudes of βiwithi >0 are
signiﬁcantly smaller than β0sec, and decrease with the increase of time lag i. Coeﬃcient β5sec
is negative and signiﬁcant for more than half of the stocks, a nd negative and signiﬁcant β10sec
is also observed in almost half of the stocks. This implies th at for almost half of the stocks
the trading volumes of transactions inside trade packages h ave temporary negative eﬀects on
price returns for at least 5 −10 seconds. With rare exceptions, the stocks have nonsigniﬁ cant
coeﬃcients βifor large time lag i≥15 seconds. For the trading volumes of transactions inside
trade packages executed as limit orders, a temporary impact is also observed. Negative β0secAugust 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3

transaction inside trade package.
The temporary impact of transactions inside trade packages for individuals persists over a
horizonlonger than theimpact timeforinstitutions. InTab le6, theestimated coeﬃcients βiwith
i= 0,5,10,15,20,25 seconds using the records of transactions inside trade pa ckages executed as
market orders from individuals are depicted. Coeﬃcient β0secis positive and signiﬁcant for all
the 23 stocks, which further veriﬁes the strong impact of the trading volume on the current price
return. Moreover, β0secis larger than the magnitudes of coeﬃcients βiwithi >0. Coeﬃcients
βiwith time lag 5 ≤i≤20 seconds are negative and signiﬁcant for most stocks, and β25secis
signiﬁcant for almost half of the stocks. This implies that t he trading volumes of transactions
inside trade packages for individuals have temporary negat ive eﬀects on price returns for about
20−25 seconds. Similar to the trading volumes executed as limit ed orders from institutions, the
trading volumes executed as limited orders from individual s have a negative impact on current
price returns, and the following price returns tend to rever se soon.
5.3.2. Modeling price returns
It has been shown that the trading volumes of transactions in side trade packages have a
signiﬁcant impact on price returns. We model the price retur nR(t) taking into account both
the autoregressive components of previous returns R(t−j) and the previous trading volumes
v(t−i) within trade packages. The regression from is

where ln v(t−i) = 0 when there is no transaction inside trade package execut ed at time t−i. We
do not separately consider the eﬀects of trading volumes of th e transactions concurrently traded
with those transactions inside trade packages, but contrib ute their impact to the corresponding
price returns. The coeﬃcient βireﬂects the response of the return R(t) to the trading volume
of transaction inside trade package executed iseconds before time t. We have veriﬁed that the
trading volumes of transactions inside trade packages have a temporary impact on price returns
for less than half a minute, and therefore we restrict I= 25 seconds. The parameter Jis also
set toJ= 25 seconds to simplify the regression.
We report the estimated coeﬃcients βiby ﬁtting Equation (19) with i= 0,5,10,15,20,25
seconds using the records of transactions inside trade pack ages executed as market orders from
institutions in Table 7. According to the R2in the last column, the ﬁtted model could explain
considerable portion, generally has R2≥20%, of the variance in price returns. For i= 0, positive
and signiﬁcant coeﬃcient β0secis observed in all the 23 stocks, displaying values signiﬁca ntly
larger than the magnitudes of βiwithi >0. This further conﬁrms that the trading volumes of
transactions inside trade packages executed as market orde rs have a strong impact on current
price returns. However, the negative relation between the p rice return and the trading volume
executed 5secondsbeforeisweakened, not as signiﬁcant ast hat observedin thesimpleregression
of Equation (18). After taking into account the autoregress ive components, only ﬁve stocks have
signiﬁcant coeﬃcients β5sec, and four of them are negative. To further increase the time l agi,
the number of stocks which have signiﬁcant coeﬃcients βiis even smaller. The shortening of
the impact time may because the price return can be partially explained by the autoregressive
components of previous returns.
We also obtain the coeﬃcients βiby estimating Equation (19) usingthe records of transactio ns

most stocks. Coeﬃcient β0secfor individuals is positive and signiﬁcant for all the stock s, but
approximately one order of magnitude smaller than β0secfor institutions. This implies that the
positive impact of trading volumes on current price returns for individuals is not as strong as
that for institutions. More than half of the stocks have nega tive and signiﬁcant coeﬃcients βi
fori≤25 seconds. This indicates that for more than half of the stoc ks the trading volumes of
transactions inside trade packages have a temporary negati ve impact for at least 25 seconds. In
comparison with the trading volumes for institutions, the t rading volumes for individuals have
a negative price impact over a relatively longer horizon eve n after considering the autoregressive
components of previous returns.

This paper studies the characteristic properties of trade p ackages made by both institutional
and individual investors trading on Shenzhen Stock Exchang e. The sequence of transactions are
grouped into packages with mostly buy or sell trades separat ed by the break of 1 ,5,10 days. The
probability distributions of the variables, i.e., the exec ution time T, the number of trades Nand
the total trading volume V, characterizing trade packages show power-law tails, and a power-law
ﬁtting method based on KSstatistic is adopted to estimate their exponents. The expon ent of
the execution time is smaller than 1.0, and the exponent of th e trades number is around 3.0
close to that of the total trading volume. The exponents vary with the break length, and tend
to be constant for the break length longer than 5 days. Moreov er, the exponents for individuals
are slightly larger than those for institutions. The scalin g relations between these variables are
also detected. All the scaling exponents show values smalle r than 1.0, diﬀerent from those found
by Vaglica et al.(2008) and Moro et al.(2009).
We have also studied the trading proﬁle of the trade packages accomplished within one day. By
investigating the mean trading volume of the individual tra nsactions inside trade packages, we
ﬁnd that large amounts of shares are more likely to be execute d close to the opening and closingAugust 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3

time respectively for institutions and individuals. The pr obability distribution of the transaction
time shows that both institutional and individual investor s trade more frequently after the
midday break, and it displays a maximum at the closing time of the day. This phenomena might
beexplained by their preferenceson theinitial and ﬁnal tim eof tradepackages. Theproﬁleof the
total trading volume further implies that institutions may be more informed than individuals.
The price impact of trade packages and its relations with the execution time Tand the
total trading volume Vare analyzed respectively. We ﬁnd the price impact remains n onzero
over the whole period of execution time. The price impact has an empirical power-law relation
with the total trading volume. Furthermore, the instantane ous price impact of the transactions
inside trade packages is investigated, and transactions cl ose to the opening and closing time of
the day have a stronger impact than those during the remainde r of the day. Similar to trade
packages, the transactions inside trade packages also show a power-law dependence on their
correspondingvolumes. To study the temporary impact of tra nsactions inside trade packages, we
regress the price return against its current and previous tr ading volumes within trade packages,
and further model the price return taking into account both t he autoregressive components
of previous returns and the current and previous trading vol umes within trade packages. The
regression results show that the trading volumes of the tran sactions inside trade packages have
a strong positive impact on current price returns, while the reversals of the following prices are
less strong and persist over only a few seconds. This may help explain the permanent impact
of isolated transactions revealed in the empirical study of block trades (Keim and Madhavan
1996, Gregoriou 2008, Kraus and Stoll 1972, Gemmill 1996). I n addition, the impact of trading
volumes on current price returns for institutions is strong er than that for individuals, and the
price reversal for individuals persists over a horizon rela tively longer than that for institutions.
Though the transactions inside trade packages have a tempor ary impact persisting over only
a few seconds, the cumulative impact of trade packages is sig niﬁcant over the whole period of
execution time (Gemmill 1996).August 6, 2018 21:40 Quantitative Finance Trading˙package ˙v3
