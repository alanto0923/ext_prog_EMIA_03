Error reading file ./prompt_new_made/1-preamble.md: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './prompt_new_made/1-preamble.md'...
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The error message you're seeing indicates that the Python script is trying to read a file named `1-preamble.md` in the directory `./prompt_new_made`, but this file does not exist.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. Check if the file exists
Make sure that the file `1-preamble.md` actually exists in the specified location (`./prompt_new_made`). You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and navigating to the directory where the script is located, then typing `ls ./prompt_new_made/1-preamble.md` (on Linux/Mac) or `dir ./prompt_new_made\1-preamble.md` (on Windows).

### 2. Verify file path
Double-check that the file path in your Python script is correct. The error message suggests that the directory name contains a space (`./prompt_new_made/`). Make sure to include spaces correctly.

### 3. Use absolute paths or relative paths with caution
If you're using an absolute path, ensure it's correct and points to the actual location of the file. If you're using a relative path, make sure it's correct and takes into account any directory changes that might occur during execution.

### 4. Handle non-existent files
You can use Python's `os` module to check if the file exists before trying to read it:

```python
import os

file_path = './prompt_new_made/1-preamble.md'
if not os.path.exists(file_path):
    print(f"File {file_path} does not exist.")
else:
    # Read the file or handle its existence as needed.
```

### 5. Consider using a try-except block
Wrap your file reading code in a `try`-`except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur when trying to read the file:

```python
import os

file_path = './prompt_new_made/1-preamble.md'
try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        # Read the file or handle its contents.
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {file_path} does not exist.")
```

By following these steps and using appropriate error handling techniques, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully read your files.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
It seems like you're experiencing two separate issues:

1. The first error is related to a Markdown file that doesn't exist.
2. The second error is related to an Excel file that doesn't exist.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve these issues:

### 1. Check if the Markdown file exists

Make sure that the file `2-file_structure.md` actually exists in the specified location (`./prompt_new_made`). You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and navigating to the directory where the script is located, then typing `ls ./prompt_new_made/2-file_structure.md` (on Linux/Mac) or `dir ./prompt_new_made\2-file_structure.md` (on Windows).

### 2. Verify file path for Excel file

Double-check that the file path in your Python script is correct. The error message suggests that the directory name contains a space (`./data/HK_stock_earning_reports.xlsx`). Make sure to include spaces correctly.

### 3. Handle non-existent files

You can use Python's `os` module to check if the files exist before trying to read them:

```python
import os

# Markdown file
markdown_file_path = './prompt_new_made/2-file_structure.md'
if not os.path.exists(markdown_file_path):
    print(f"File {markdown_file_path} does not exist.")
else:
    # Read the file or handle its existence as needed.

# Excel file
excel_file_path = './data/HK_stock_earning_reports.xlsx'
if not os.path.exists(excel_file_path):
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist.")
```

### 4. Consider using a try-except block

Wrap your file reading code in a `try`-`except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur when trying to read the files:

```python
import os

# Markdown file
markdown_file_path = './prompt_new_made/2-file_structure.md'
try:
    with open(markdown_file_path, 'r') as f:
        # Read the file or handle its contents.
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {markdown_file_path} does not exist.")

# Excel file
excel_file_path = './data/HK_stock_earning_reports.xlsx'
try:
    import pandas as pd  # Import pandas library if needed
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path)  # Read the Excel file
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist.")
```

By following these steps and using appropriate error handling techniques, you should be able to resolve the issues and successfully read your files.

### Additional suggestions:

* Make sure that the directory paths are correct and match the actual location of the files.
* Consider using absolute paths instead of relative paths to avoid potential issues with directory changes.
* If you're working with large files or complex file structures, consider using a more robust file handling approach, such as using a library like `pathlib` or `os.path.join`.

It seems like you're experiencing another issue with a Markdown file that doesn't exist.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. Check if the Markdown file exists

Make sure that the file `3-index1.md` actually exists in the specified location (`./prompt_new_made`). You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and navigating to the directory where the script is located, then typing `ls ./prompt_new_made/3-index1.md` (on Linux/Mac) or `dir ./prompt_new_made\3-index1.md` (on Windows).

### 2. Verify file path

Double-check that the file path in your Python script is correct. The error message suggests that the directory name contains a space (`./prompt_new_made`). Make sure to include spaces correctly.

### 3. Handle non-existent files

if not os.path.exists(markdown_file_path):
    print(f"File {markdown_file_path} does not exist.")
else:
    # Read the file or handle its existence as needed.

# Excel file
excel_file_path = './data/combined_factor_analysis_results.xlsx'
if not os.path.exists(excel_file_path):
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist.")
```

### 4. Consider using a try-except block

Wrap your file reading code in a `try`-`except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur when trying to read the files:

```python
import os

# Markdown file
markdown_file_path = './prompt_new_made/3-index1.md'
try:
    with open(markdown_file_path, 'r') as f:
        # Read the file or handle its contents.
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {markdown_file_path} does not exist.")

# Excel file
excel_file_path = './data/combined_factor_analysis_results.xlsx'
try:
    import pandas as pd  # Import pandas library if needed
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path)  # Read the Excel file
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist.")
```

```python
try:
    import pandas as pd  # Import pandas library if needed
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path)  # Read the Excel file
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist. Skipping...")
    # Add some default value or skip the file here

The error message you're seeing indicates that the Python script is trying to read a file named `1-preamble.md` in the directory `./prompt_new_made`, but this file does not exist.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. Check if the file exists
Make sure that the file `1-preamble.md` actually exists in the specified location (`./prompt_new_made`). You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and navigating to the directory where the script is located, then typing `ls ./prompt_new_made/1-preamble.md` (on Linux/Mac) or `dir ./prompt_new_made\1-preamble.md` (on Windows).

### 2. Verify file path
Double-check that the file path in your Python script is correct. The error message suggests that the directory name contains a space (`./prompt_new_made/`). Make sure to include spaces correctly.

### 3. Use absolute paths or relative paths with caution
If you're using an absolute path, ensure it's correct and points to the actual location of the file. If you're using a relative path, make sure it's correct and takes into account any directory changes that might occur during execution.

### 4. Handle non-existent files
You can use Python's `os` module to check if the file exists before trying to read it:

```python
import os

file_path = './prompt_new_made/1-preamble.md'
if not os.path.exists(file_path):
    print(f"File {file_path} does not exist.")
else:
    # Read the file or handle its existence as needed.
```

### 5. Consider using a try-except block
Wrap your file reading code in a `try`-`except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur when trying to read the file:

```python
import os

file_path = './prompt_new_made/1-preamble.md'
try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        # Read the file or handle its contents.
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {file_path} does not exist.")
```

By following these steps and using appropriate error handling techniques, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully read your files.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
It seems like you're experiencing two separate issues:

1. The first error is related to a Markdown file that doesn't exist.
2. The second error is related to an Excel file that doesn't exist.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve these issues:

### 1. Check if the Markdown file exists

Make sure that the file `2-file_structure.md` actually exists in the specified location (`./prompt_new_made`). You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and navigating to the directory where the script is located, then typing `ls ./prompt_new_made/2-file_structure.md` (on Linux/Mac) or `dir ./prompt_new_made\2-file_structure.md` (on Windows).

### 2. Verify file path for Excel file

Double-check that the file path in your Python script is correct. The error message suggests that the directory name contains a space (`./data/HK_stock_earning_reports.xlsx`). Make sure to include spaces correctly.

### 3. Handle non-existent files

You can use Python's `os` module to check if the files exist before trying to read them:

```python
import os

# Markdown file
markdown_file_path = './prompt_new_made/2-file_structure.md'
if not os.path.exists(markdown_file_path):
    print(f"File {markdown_file_path} does not exist.")
else:
    # Read the file or handle its existence as needed.

# Excel file
excel_file_path = './data/HK_stock_earning_reports.xlsx'
if not os.path.exists(excel_file_path):
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist.")
```

### 4. Consider using a try-except block

Wrap your file reading code in a `try`-`except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur when trying to read the files:

```python
import os

# Markdown file
markdown_file_path = './prompt_new_made/2-file_structure.md'
try:
    with open(markdown_file_path, 'r') as f:
        # Read the file or handle its contents.
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {markdown_file_path} does not exist.")

# Excel file
excel_file_path = './data/HK_stock_earning_reports.xlsx'
try:
    import pandas as pd  # Import pandas library if needed
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path)  # Read the Excel file
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist.")
```

By following these steps and using appropriate error handling techniques, you should be able to resolve the issues and successfully read your files.

### Additional suggestions:

* Make sure that the directory paths are correct and match the actual location of the files.
* Consider using absolute paths instead of relative paths to avoid potential issues with directory changes.
* If you're working with large files or complex file structures, consider using a more robust file handling approach, such as using a library like `pathlib` or `os.path.join`.

It seems like you're experiencing another issue with a Markdown file that doesn't exist.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. Check if the Markdown file exists

Make sure that the file `3-index1.md` actually exists in the specified location (`./prompt_new_made`). You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and navigating to the directory where the script is located, then typing `ls ./prompt_new_made/3-index1.md` (on Linux/Mac) or `dir ./prompt_new_made\3-index1.md` (on Windows).

### 2. Verify file path

Double-check that the file path in your Python script is correct. The error message suggests that the directory name contains a space (`./prompt_new_made`). Make sure to include spaces correctly.

### 3. Handle non-existent files

if not os.path.exists(markdown_file_path):
    print(f"File {markdown_file_path} does not exist.")
else:
    # Read the file or handle its existence as needed.

# Excel file
excel_file_path = './data/combined_factor_analysis_results.xlsx'
if not os.path.exists(excel_file_path):
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist.")
```

### 4. Consider using a try-except block

Wrap your file reading code in a `try`-`except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur when trying to read the files:

```python
import os

# Markdown file
markdown_file_path = './prompt_new_made/3-index1.md'
try:
    with open(markdown_file_path, 'r') as f:
        # Read the file or handle its contents.
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {markdown_file_path} does not exist.")

# Excel file
excel_file_path = './data/combined_factor_analysis_results.xlsx'
try:
    import pandas as pd  # Import pandas library if needed
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path)  # Read the Excel file
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist.")
```

```python
try:
    import pandas as pd  # Import pandas library if needed
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path)  # Read the Excel file
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File {excel_file_path} does not exist. Skipping...")
