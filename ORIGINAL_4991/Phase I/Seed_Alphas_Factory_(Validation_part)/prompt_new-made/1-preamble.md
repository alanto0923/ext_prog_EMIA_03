Please correlate the earnings reports of the listed companies represented by the Hang Seng Index for a certain number of quarters with the performance of a given Alpha Factor in the Hang Seng Index for the quarter following those quarters, and learn how to predict which Alpha to use for trading in the next quarter following those quarters, when you are given the earnings reports of the companies in the Hang Seng Index for the previous quarters. Below I will upload, in sequence, the earnings reports of the listed companies represented in the Hang Seng Index from March 31, 2024 to December 31, 2024 and the factor performance of different Alpha in the Hang Seng Index for the period March 24, 2020 to March 24, 2025. Please study the relationship between them so that you can deduce which Alpha will be suitable for trading from March 24, 2020 to March 24, 2025 after you are given the earnings reports of the companies in the Hang Seng Index for four quarters from 03/31/2024 to 12/31/2024.
